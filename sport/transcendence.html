			<h2>Plenty of life left in these old legs</h2>
			<p><br />
			  Tuesday October 10, 2006<br />
			  By Juliet Rowan<br />
              <br />
            An 80-year-old Tauranga man hopes his new world record in distance walking will be an inspiration for other elderly people to compete in sport.              </p>
			<p>			  Colin Clifton walked 68.4km in 12 hours at the <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/index.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> long-distance track-walking championships in Auckland on Saturday.              </p>
			<p>			  It was the great-grandfather of two's first year in the 80-plus age group and he passed the previous world record in the category by 1.4km.<br />
              <br />
&quot;I was thrilled to get an official world record,&quot; Mr Clifton said. &quot;It was something I'd been aiming for the whole time I've been walking.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              Mr Clifton, a retired bush contractor, took up walking eight years ago when he found himself struggling to run.<br />
              <br />
              He has run and walked 32 marathons and 50 ultra-marathons in his life, covering distances up to 100km.<br />
              <br />
              His performance on Saturday puts him at the top of his age group for athletes competing in endurance events, run worldwide by Indian spiritual leader Sri Chinmoy.<br />
              <br />
              Competitors in various age categories ran or walked the furthest distance they could in six, 12 or 24 hours for the New Zealand championships.<br />
              <br />
              Mr Clifton walked non-stop from 9am to 9pm, apart from toilet breaks, although the rules allow competitors to rest.<br />
              <br />
&quot;Some stop and lie down for a while,&quot; he said. &quot;I just like to keep going because once I stop I don't like to start again.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              He sustained himself with bits of chocolate and other &quot;junk food&quot;.<br />
              <br />
              Mr Clifton said the rules in Sri Chinmoy races were less stringent than in athletics speed-walking competitions, for example, and for that reason were ideal for older people.<br />
              <br />
              He hoped his performance would inspire others to enter sports competitions.<br />
              <br />
              Mr Clifton enters all kinds of walking races but said the Sri Chinmoy philosophy of &quot;self-transcendence&quot; suited his outlook.<br />
              <br />
&quot;You set your life by limitations but you can rise above your limitations if you put your mind to it.</p>
