<h1>Meditation for Beginners </h1>
<h4><br />
    What is Meditation? </h4>
<p><br />
    Meditation is the practise of silencing the mind. If we can make our mind  silent and stop our thoughts, this is real meditation. If we can silence the  mind, we will discover an inner sense of peace and joy. This is inner happiness  and inner peace is the aim of meditation. </p>
<h4><br />
    Can anybody learn to Meditate? </h4>
<p><br />
    Meditation is something that anybody can do. The only requirement is the  willingness to try and practise on your own. Meditation is something to be  practised and not just read about. Everybody has the capacity to meditate well;  everyone is able to control their own thoughts. However, it may take time and  perseverance. </p>
<h4><br />
    I try to Meditate buy my mind becomes filled with thoughts </h4>
<p><br />
    Firstly, it is not an uncommon experience. The mind is filled with thoughts  because we are so used to thinking and using the mind. When we try to stop the  mind completely, the mind often rebels. However, if we persevere, we can learn  to still the mind. Meditation teacher, Sri Chinmoy, advises meditating in the  spiritual heart. If we throw our mind into the heart, it is much easier to  learn to meditate. <br />
    <br />
&quot;<em>The mind has limits beyond which it cannot go without the help of the  heart and soul. That is why I say that when the ordinary mind comes to the  fore, you have to take it as a bundle of imperfection and throw it into the  heart.</em>&quot; <br />
<br />

</p>
<h4>  How Long should I meditate for? </h4>
<p>  If we are just learning to meditate, 10 minutes, may be a good length to start.  However, over time we should try to extend our period of meditation. The  important thing though, is not the length of time, but the quality of our  meditation. If we meditate for half an hour, but just sit with random thoughts  going through our mind, this is not real meditation. It is better to meditate  for 15 minutes with focus and intensity. </p>
<h4><br />
  How do I know if I am meditating well? </h4>
<p>  A good meditation involves raising our consciousness. If we have a good feeling  for the world, if we have a sense of inner peace and inner happiness, then this  is good meditation. Meditation enables us to feel sincerely happy, even if  nobody is giving us things in the outer world. If we feel energised and  inspired to do good things, this is also a good sign. However, don't be  discouraged if you cannot meditate well in the beginning. If you feel compelled  to meditate every day, this is a good sign that your soul is receiving  something from your meditation. </p>
<h4><br />
  Do I need to believe in a certain philosophy to meditate? </h4>
<p>  Meditation is practised by people from different religions, no religion and  different spiritual traditions. The philosophy you hold is not of primary  importance; meditation involves going beyond the domain of the mind. Meditation  is about consciousness not about mental belief's. People may approach  meditation from different angles, but it leads towards the same goal of  uplifting our consciousness and becoming aware of our extended reality. <br />
