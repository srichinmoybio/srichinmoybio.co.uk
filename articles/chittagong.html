			<h1>To Be A Chittagonian</h1>
			<p>by Dr. Vidagdha Bennett </p>
			<p>              One of the most remarkable things I have ever witnessed is two  Chittagonians meeting each other for the first time. No reunion with a  long-lost member of the family could be sweeter or more emotional.  Within the span of just a few minutes, two perfect strangers will  invariably light upon a distant cousin in common or a shared  schoolteacher or some other tenuous but infinitely precious connection.  Considering that there are around 14 million Chittagonians, not  including expatriates, the number of such coincidences is astounding. </p>
			<p>			  Chittagong is the chief Indian Ocean port city in the south-east  of Bangladesh. The name also refers to one of the six divisions in  Bangladesh. Even though Bengali, a derivative of Sanskrit, is spoken  and taught throughout Bangladesh, the residents of Chittagong Division  much prefer to speak their own dialect. The curious thing is that  Chittagong dialect has no official status and is not taught at any  level in schools. It exists solely as an oral language, with subtle  variations from north to south, and from Muslim to Hindu. In the  written form, correct Bengali is used exclusively. </p>
			<p>			  Perhaps it is the fact that Chittagong dialect (or Chatgaiyan  Buli) is heard rather than seen that makes the Chittagonians so proud  of it, and so delighted to employ it&mdash;and at dazzling speed! </p>
			<p>			  The history of Chittagong as a renowned trading centre from  ancient times may have contributed to this unique linguistic  phenomenon. Merchants from Turkey, Portugal, Persia, Afghanistan and  the Arabian Peninsula all left an indelible stamp on the language and  culture of the area&mdash;an influence that is reflected nowhere else in  Bangladesh or West Bengal. There is also a large proportion of English  words in Chittagong dialect&mdash;a legacy of the British East India Company  to which Chittagong was ceded in 1760. </p>
			<p>			  Contemporary spiritual Teacher Sri Chinmoy happens to hail from  the small village of East Shakpura in Chittagong District. Although he  has resided in New York since 1964, he has never forgotten his roots.  He has written more than 13,000 devotional songs in the Bengali  language which is currently the sixth most widely spoken language in  the world, and the most neglected by foreign learners, according to  Bengali expert William Radice at the University of London's School of  Oriental and African Studies. <br />
	          Most significantly perhaps, <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/biography.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> dedicated his 13,000th  song (which he composed in 2006) to his beloved land of birth. The  English transliteration of the song reads: </p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p><br />
			    Shakpura Shakpura purba Shakpura gram <br />
			    Amar janma dham dham dham <br />
			    Chatrala Chatrala Chatrala Chatragram <br />
			    Prerana eshana nayana abhiram <br />
			    Amar mata Bangadesh Bangadesh Bangadesh <br />
			    Sneher banya nai je shesh nai je shesh shesh <br />
			    Bharat mata paye thami thami thami <br />
			    Sethai mama antara jyami </p>
		    </blockquote>
			<p><br />
		    In 1986, Sri Chinmoy visited Chittagong town and East Shakpura  after an absence of forty-two years. There he came to learn for the  first time that attempts were being made to establish a written form of  Chittagong dialect. He was so inspired and encouraged by this news that  composed a handful of songs in his native tongue. These songs celebrate  the natural beauty and harmony of the region, especially the Karnaphuli  River and its environs. Here is the English transliteration of two of  these songs: </p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p><br />
			    Karnaphuli bhoirabh padma ar meghna <br />
			    Toara ar dila ajwa swarga prerana <br />
			    <br />
			    Chatg&acirc; ar chatg&acirc; manat pare t&ocirc;ar katha <br />
			    Hakkal samat t&ocirc;ar sneha loi jaijon <br />
		      Duniyar gharat gharat </p>
		    </div>
			<p><br />
            Other writers share Sri Chinmoy's rapture for Chittagong. The  Chinese poet Huen Tsang, who travelled to Chittagong in the 7th  century, described it as &quot;a sleeping beauty emerging from mists and  water.&quot; </p>
			<p>			  Sri Chinmoy has also celebrated his birthplace by writing stories  about the life of Surya Sen (Masterda), who was in the vanguard of  resistance against British rule; by composing songs saluting Kaji  Najrul Islam, who lived near Chittagong; as well as poems dedicated to  the nation of Bangladesh. <br />
		    Sri Chinmoy left Chittagong in 1944, at the age of twelve. Both  his parents had passed away within the previous year, and so he went to  join his older brothers and sisters at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in  Pondicherry, South India. But his recollections of his childhood  village life are among his sweetest memories. He writes, </p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p><br />
		      &quot;On the one hand, I am a cosmopolitan. I am a spiritual man meant  for the whole world. But still, when I hear the names 'Shakpura' or  'Chittagong', immediately my heart gets joy. There are quite a few  places in India and Bangladesh whose very name gives me tremendous joy  and tremendous inner thrill. But what gives me utmost joy is the name  'Chittagong', and specially 'Shakpura'. In every field, we appreciate,  admire and adore vastness, but the qualities of sweetness, fondness and  intimacy develop inside littleness. For me, that littleness is  symbolised by my childhood village home.&quot; </p>
		    </div>
			<p><br />
              Time and again I have witnessed Sri Chinmoy's joy at discovering a  fellow Chittagonian in some remote corner of the world. I recall him  speaking delightedly with a Chittagonian restaurant owner in Chiang  Mai, Thailand; finding in Burma the sons of someone who went to school  with his elder brother; breaking off in mid-conversation with a  high-ranking Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations to chat with  a shy waiter in a New York Indian restaurant who had newly arrived from  Bangladesh. <br />
            Chittagonians have much to teach the rest of the world. They  think of themselves as a large, closely-knit family and they are  intensely proud of their heritage and traditions&mdash;their  freedom-fighters, their bards, their broad Karnaphuli River upon which  ferries ply to and from the villages, the small hills that denote the  end of the grand Himalayan mountain chain, the rich green of the paddy  fields, the serenity of their ponds, the delicious quality of their  mangoes and hilsa fish. </p>
			<p>			  To have the good fortune to meet a Chittagonian is to want to  catch the next flight available to see this paradise with your own  eyes. As Sri Chinmoy wrote in 2003, </p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p><br />
			    &quot;My Chittagong, <br />
			    May the world-citizens <br />
			    To your heart-beauty throng.&quot; </p>
		    </blockquote>
