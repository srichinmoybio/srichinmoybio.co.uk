			<h1>How To Cure Depression </h1>
			<p>Depression and unhappiness is a miserable experience. There is nothing  worse than a feeling of depression, we should seek to try and avoid  depression as much as possible. <br />
              <br />
		      To Overcome Depression there are a number of things that we can try and do. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>1. Do not Dwell on Depressed Thoughts. </strong><br />
              <br />
		      If we always ruminate over our depressed mindset it will be very  difficult, if not impossible, to overcome our depression. Our thoughts  influence our state of mind very strongly. Sometimes our depressed  thoughts can appear quite powerful, but we need to try and let go of  them. If we constantly say no to negative and depressed thoughts, there  will come a time when they will stop bothering us. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>2. Focus on Positive Things. </strong><br />
              <br />
		      If it is difficult to stop negative thoughts occurring, another  suggestion is to focus on good, inspiring, uplifting thoughts. When we  feel depressed, we should force ourselves to think about something  good. This can either be about somebody else, or something we have  achieved in the past. When we are depressed we may feel to entertain  such thoughts is useless. But, even if we are unsuccessful in the  beginning, these good thoughts will slowly percolate through our mind.  It will have a positive effect over time, even if we don't expect it  to. </p>

			    Each negative thought <br />
			    Is the beginning of today's <br />
			    Unbearable self-torture. <br />
                <br />
                <br />
			    Each positive thought <br />
			    Is the beginning of tomorrow's <br />
			    Unimaginable God-rapture. </p>

              <br />
              <strong>3. Be Active </strong><br />
              <br />
              One of the best cures for depression is to engage in various  activities. When we are busy our mind does not have time to dwell on a  depressed train of thought. Physical exercise can be particularly  helpful; this is because when we exercise we release serotonin, a  helpful chemical for improving state of mind <br />
              Quite often, when we are depressed we do not feel like doing  anything. Therefore, we need to try and force ourselves to go and do  something. It may be help to do things with others. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>4. Speak to Others </strong><br />
              <br />
              When we share problems and worries with other people, we can  unburden a significant cause of our depression. When we discuss things  with others, it helps us to get a sense of perspective. It is important  to be able to find someone who will be a good listener. We shouldn't  expect others to solve our problems for us. But, at the same time we  should feel that we do not need to be entirely self-sufficient. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>5. Be Positive. <br />
              </strong><br />
              It might be difficult, but we should try to be positive and  sincerely seek to throw off our depression. It is a mistake to  encourage sympathy and feelings of self-pity. When we attract others to  console us, it will not cut off the root of depression; in fact it can  often feed the depression. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>6. Find the Joy Within. </strong><br />
              <br />
              Our real nature is joy, if we can access the soul we can experience  this inner joy, which is the underlying essence of our being. When we  are depressed we should feel that this is a false reflection of our  nature. We should feel the necessity of going beyond this temporary  state and bringing to the fore our inner happiness. <br />
              <br />
&quot;<em>But the strength of the soul's will is far greater than the  strength of these undivine forces. If you can bring forward even one  percent of your soul's willpower, with that you will be able to conquer  your depression.</em>&quot; </p>
			<p>- Sri Chinmoy [2] <br />
              <br />
			  <strong>7. Smile </strong><br />
              <br />
			  Even if the smile is false and forced it may help a little. When we  smile we can have a positive effect on our state of mind. The more we  smile and laugh the easier it is to overcome depression. <br />
