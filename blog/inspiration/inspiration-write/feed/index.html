I can relate to all of these. My best ideas, though, come during and immediately after exercise. It can be funny as often I  get home still hot and sweaty, but instead of immediately heading to the shower I get my notebook and quickly scramble notes.]]></description>

Interesting thoughts and observations. I find that if you appreciate good qualities of others, it helps to find them in yourself.


Good luck with the writing and blog]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tejvan,

I love your articles. They make so much sense to a person like me who has grown up in middle class suburbia to a father who is into business and a mother who compares her children with her friends kids.

I left India when i was 23 to pursue my higher education, ( but i guess that was an excuse to get away from the constant nagging i used to bear. ) 

I landed in Australia and  met up with my partner ( a devoted mother of 2 switched on kids) and ever since it has been a journey like none other for me. 

It has taken me almost five years to undo my desires and ambitions and take life for the way it is.  I still compare myself to others, try to dress up well, but i am using your articles and several other personal development articles I find on the internet to help me see and understand the real me .

My partner Sharon has been a great help to me to understand and appreciate the simplicities in life. She is very very switched on and she has just started putting her thoughts down. I sometimes find it difficult to comprehend what she is saying because she is most of the time ahead of the rest of the world.

I would appreciate it if you could check her website out. I would love to be able to write like you do ( oops, i&#039;m comparing again ) , so that my family would appreciate me for a person and consider me a rebel or an outlaw .

PS: I was only supposed to give you a nice comment but i ended up describing my story to you. Maybe it might inspire you to do another post :)

Please do give us your comments after you have a look at Sharon&#039;s website.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, A Singh

Interesting observation.

To an extent, I think I am aware of what others might think when choosing topics, but with most articles I&#039;m happy to just write what I think is appropriate.

BTW: Do you have a blog?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tejvan,

It was interesting to get a peek into your methods and all that goes behind the scenes before these articles hit the blog. I got to this blog through &#039;digg&#039; a while ago and got hooked.

Personally when I try to write something, I have a tendency to get attached to my ideas and my creation. The ego takes over at some point, and at a lower level, the objective shifts from “sharing my thoughts” to “proving my worth/opinion”. How others would rate me on my writing, becomes extremely important. I wonder if this “approval seeking behavior” is a common problem that is faced by others as well.]]></description>
