<p>Yoga is the ancient art of Self-Discovery, and  Self-Realisation. Yoga is a Sanskrit word meaning &#8216;Union with God&#8217;, &#8211; &#8216;Union with the Highest consciousness&#8217;. When we talk of Self-Realisation, it means realising the divine nature of our Higher Self, our Inner Pilot. A Buddhist may call it entering into Nirvana, a Hindu may talk of liberation / God-realisation. Ultimately, it is a state of consciousness beyond name and form and the limitations of the mental world. The Upanishads talks of &#8216;Sat Chid Ananda&#8217; &#8211; Existence, Consciousness, Bliss &#8211; Our highest Self &#8211; a being of pure delight.</p>
<p>Such ideas may seem very far from our present state! Given the limitations of our mind and nature, a consciousness of unbridled delight and peace seem a far cry. Most of us would  settle for just a little bit more peace, a little bit more joy. But, the highest teachings of yoga tell us that there is no end to our inner self-transcendence. &#8211; All we need to do is realise the divinity within.</p>
<p>In the West, yoga often invokes images of hatha yoga &#8211; difficult postures for calming the physical being and gaining greater peace of mind. But, hatha yoga is only one small aspect of the ancient path of yoga. There is also.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bhatki yoga</strong> &#8211; the path of love and devotion.  Bhakti yoga doesn&#8217;t worry about philosophical discourse and explanations, it merely seeks to love. It is not a human love based on possession and expectation. But, a divine, universal love without expectation or sense of possession.</li>
<li><strong>Jnana yoga</strong> &#8211; the path of wisdom &#8211; gaining true insight into our real being; a wisdom which is much more than intellectual understanding. A wisdom that comes from knowing our deepest soul through meditation.</li>
<li><strong>Karma Yoga</strong> &#8211; the path of action. Making progress through selfless service to the rest of humanity. It is selfless service without expectation of reward, recognition. It is egoless work done with detachment to the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How To Make Progress Through Yoga</h3>
<p>Yoga means we make a conscious effort to transform our consciousness. It means facing upto  and transcending our weakness. It requires a faith in God, or at least a faith in our self. It requires patience and persistence and the ability to remain focused on our self-improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Patience, Perseverance.</strong></p>
<p>Patience is sometimes viewed as a negative, or at least static thing. But true patience means ignoring the demands of the ego and accepting the transformation of nature which inevitably takes time. It is a mistake to think the path of yoga is about austerity and a bed of thorns. To seek our real self, is the most rewarding thing we can undertake. But, neither is it an easy downhill path with everything done for us. But, nothing worthwhile is without trials and challenges. We cannot give up at the first hurdle, but must remain committed to yoga, however, bumpy it is. <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/how-to-be-more-patient/">How to be more patient<br />
</a><br />
<strong>Enthusiasm.</strong></p>
<p>To make progress in any aspect of life, we need an enthusiastic attitude. It is the same with yoga, we can make the fastest progress only when we value and are enthusiastic about the goal. See: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/the-infectious-power-of-enthusiasm/">Enthusiasm </a></p>
<p><strong>Honesty / Self Appraisal.</strong></p>
<p>In yoga we need to overcome the ego. The justifications and excuse of our ego, just make our journey longer. See <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/self-criticism-and-self-encouragement/">balance between self-criticism and self-encouragement</a></p>
<p><strong>Inner Strength.</strong></p>
<p>Yoga is not for the feint hearted, sometimes, you need to go against the prevailing way of the world. We cannot allow ourselves to be sucked into materialistic goals. Yoga doesn&#8217;t negate the outer life, but, seeks to give a proper balance between inner wealth and outer wealth. This needs an inner strength to be true to our inner calling.</p>
<p>Simplicity</p>
<p>Sometimes it is the simplest things which matter in yoga. A sincere smile, doing something with love, doing something selflessly &#8211; outwardly it may not sound much but it can make a big difference in yoga.</p>
<p>Each  smile<br />
Is a radical<br />

<p>What Does it Mean to Be Free?</p>
<p>Having just sat through an insipid world cup performance by my team England, I have realised how my mood can easily be disturbed by 11 football players failing to pass a football ball as well as I expect them to. I mean they were dreadful, but,  should I be letting myself be affected by things outside my control? Well the world cup is only every four years, and I will always be a glutton for punishment (by nature I&#8217;m an optimist &#8211; I can&#8217;t help but always think this time we can win). But, football aside, we need to develop an inner freedom, a state of mind which can be free from the innumerable worries and anxieties of life. Real inner freedom is a state where we can remain unaffected by disturbing thoughts and ideas.</p>
<h3>Inner Freedom</h3>
<h4>To Feel Negative Thoughts as Separate Entities.</h4>
<p>Socrates once went to a noted sage. The sage told Socrates and his followers that Socrates had all the human limitations of anger, pride and jealousy.</p>
<p>His followers were shocked and interrupted to criticise the sage, saying they saw Socrates as a saint. However, the sage, said, &#8216;let me finish. It is true that he has all these negative qualities, but Socrates doesn&#8217;t let them affect him.&#8217;</p>
<p>As we aspire for a better life, human weaknesses will continue crop up. We cannot remain totally unaffected by old thought habits and emotions. However, we don&#8217;t have to give our acceptance and full support to these negative thoughts and emotions. We can feel these negative thoughts and emotions as separate to our real self. If we see these thoughts and emotions as separate and outside our self, then we can remain free from there power. We can remain centred in our real self. This is the secret of inner freedom because we can detach from thoughts and emotions that drag us down and round in circles.</p>
<p>We can have all the outer freedom we want to live exactly as we want. But, if we unable to let go of jealousy and insecurity, then we are not free to be inwardly happy; we will be constantly limiting ourself.</p>
<h4>To be Free of Desires we Don&#8217;t Want.</h4>
<p>It is the nature of desire to remain unfulfilled or be disappointed. The more desires we have, the more prone to disappointment we will be. There are still good things to aim for. There is no harm in aspiring to be a better person and to achieve worthwhile goals. But, to limit material desires, and desires from other people lifts a great pressure off our state of mind. If we have innumerable desires we always feel a sense of dissatisfaction until they fulfilled in our own way. We can become a slave of our desires, making us sacrifice worthwhile principles to get what we want. Yet, even when we get our desire, we soon realise it isn&#8217;t the secret of inner peace and contentment. Inner freedom is to be the master of our own desire.</p>
<h4>To be Free from Peer Pressure</h4>
<p>Friends, society and government consciously or unconsciously place expectations on our behaviour, attitude and actions. There is a pressure to conform to certain pre-conceived attitudes. If you look over the past 100-200 years, you can see how concepts of morality and reasonable behaviour are constantly changing. To be free from these subtle pressures is essential to give us our inner peace and enable us to be inwardly free.</p>
<p>To be free from peer pressure doesn&#8217;t mean we have to be the natural born rebel, always trying to shock people; this can become it&#8217;s own ideology. Having a shocking hairstyle is not the be all and end all or symbol of inner freedom. The real secret is the inner attitude. It is to quietly question prevailing values like materialistic goals; it is to have the self-confidence and inner faith to live as we feel inwardly inspired.</p>
<h4>Knowing our Real Self.</h4>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What is false freedom? False freedom is our constant and deliberate acceptance of ignorance and our conscious existence in ignorance. What is real freedom? Real freedom is our conscious awareness of our inner divinity, and our constant inseparable oneness with the Inner Pilot.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy (1)<br />
To be really free, we have to be able live in our real self. The self that is spontaneous, happy, non-judgemental and cheerful. It is the <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/remaining-young-at-heart/">childlike quality</a> we all have within us. It is this source of human creativity and real joy. We have all felt this at some times in our life. We feel uninhibited and can access that creative aspect of ourselves. We can know this real self through living in the heart &#8211; living away from the critical mind; it is something we can access through meditation and contemplation. The irony is this inner freedom requires discipline.</p>

<p>We are constantly judging other people, our self and situations. It can feel like life is a constant reality TV show with a panel of judges always in evidence. But, the judgemental nature of the mind, will neither give us peace or happiness. To attain a real inner peace, we have to go far beyond the judgemental game of inferiority and superiority.</p>
<h3>Why Be Less Judgemental</h3>
<p><strong>We Suffer</strong></p>
<p>When we judge others, it&#8217;s hard to not have a feeling (consciously or unconsciously) of superiority / pride. When we judge others we lower our own consciousness.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we judge others with our unlit human mind, with the  intellectual mind, with the sophisticated mind, the persons whom we  judge do not lose an iota of their achievement, of their reality. But we  lose. How do we lose? When we start doubting others, we offer something  of our own existence to the outer world something of our own reality  goes and eventually we become very weak.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy (1)</p>
<p><strong>We may be Wrong. </strong></p>
<p>When judging others we are often judging only a small part of their nature. It may even be second hand information. We may hear someone&#8217;s opinion and take it as gospel. But, who is to say they haven&#8217;t put their own slant and perspective on the other person. Even when we seem someone first hand we may misunderstand their motives or inner attitude. We can never know what is going on inside a person. Every is fighting their own battles and trying to be a better person in their own way. We cannot expect every to be at the stage of sainthood in this incarnation.</p>
<p><strong>How would we want to be judged?</strong></p>
<p>When we do something good, of course, we want the whole world to know about it. But, when we do something bad or unfortunate we would really like it to be kept quiet. If we take delight in people&#8217;s misfortunes then it is a big mistake, and it is likely to happen to us.</p>
<h3>How To Be Less Judgemental</h3>
<p><strong>Be Sympathetic<br />
</strong></p>
<p>When we see someone doing something wrong, we can feel that this is something we could be doing wrong ourselves. Ironically, when we criticise faults in others, we often have the same faults ourselves. If we remember we are as prone to misjudgement and doing the wrong thing then it gives us more compassion and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Be supportive not critical</strong>.</p>
<p>Judging others rarely helps to change others behaviour for the better. Being supportive can change.</p>
<p><strong>Concentrate on Being Happy</strong>.</p>
<p>When we get bogged down in judging others, we wont gain much happiness. Happiness comes from enjoying the good things in life, not in giving sermons on the failings of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Look Upon People as an Extended Family.</strong></p>
<p>If someone close to us does something wrong we are more willing to forgive and see their better qualities. When judging friends or work colleagues see them as an extended part of your self / family, this will give us a more sympathetic approach.</p>
<p><strong>Being Right Isn&#8217;t the Most Important Thing.</strong></p>
<p>In judging others, there is a strong desire to be right and show others as wrong. But life isn&#8217;t all about being right. It&#8217;s about quietly making a positive contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Only Yourself.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother&#8217;s eye and pay  no  attention to the plank in your own eye&#8221; Matthew 7:3</p></blockquote>
<p>If we have to judge, why not judge yourself and see how you can improve yourself as a person? Don&#8217;t make the mistake of blaming your difficulties on others. Difficulties come from some defect in our own character.</p>
<h3>Dealing With Judgemental People.</h3>
<p>Some people are very judgemental. They have a habit of making us feel small / guilty. It also encourages us to be judgemental in response. We either seek to defend ourselves or start judging others &#8211; joining in their game of judging people.</p>
<p>It can also be difficult to disagree with judgemental people, as they often can have deep conviction in their beliefs.</p>
<p>The best way of dealing with judgemental people is not to directly challenge them, but, allow them to go their way, whilst we maintain our quiet approach. Don&#8217;t worry about having the last word or defending yourself. If they are really making unfair criticisms of friends, you can always point to their good qualities. But, you are unlikely to change their nature so don&#8217;t expect too much.</p>

<p>Sometimes it feels quite easy to write what you want you should do. In fact, when you write everything down the task of self-improvement looks quite easy! But, alas, knowing what to do is only part of the problem. Even when we have resolved what we want to do, part of our human nature can cling to its old habits, emotions and thought patterns. Even when we no longer want to pursue a certain emotion, it still can come to the fore despite our mental rejection.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it can feel like there are two parts to our self. There is the one positive part aspiring for a better consciousness. At times we glimpse this and feel a sincere happiness. At other times, we can feel overpowered by some undesirable aspect of our nature.</p>
<p>The first thing to bear in mind, is that everyone has this experience of making a few steps forward and a few steps backwards. It is necessary to accept our transformation takes time. &#8211; See: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/inspiration/changing-yourself-by-accepting-yourself/">Changing yourself by accepting yourself</a>. It is often just when we think we have made great progress and overcome some emotion like anger, that it re-appears out of nowhere and takes us by surprise. Human nature does take a long time to transform. But, when we experience the stubbornness of our own nature, it is important to bear in mind a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t be depressed or mad with yourself for a temporary relapse. By becoming depressed over our weaknesses, we only strengthen them. A feeling of guilt or despondency is also very unhelpful. If we see it is a inevitable step in our self improvement then it loses much of its power. See: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/how-to-stop-feeling-sorry-for-yourself/">Avoiding Self Pity</a></li>
<li>At the same time, we must distance ourselves from this emotion. We shouldn&#8217;t give it any mental support. By distancing ourselves from our negative emotion, it helps us to detach and slowly the experience will dissipate.</li>
<li>A quiet but firm resolve to overcome any difficulty is the most effective way of quickly overcoming them. We should avoid elation at a good experience and despondency at depressing experiences. But, we do need flexibility and a willingness to give up old thought patterns and habitual responses.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>I enjoy peace<br />
Only when I am not afraid<br />
Of changing my stubborn mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy (1)</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t Over Analyse / focus on your Negative Qualities. The best way to overcome negative qualities is simply to aspire for more light and concentrate on doing the right thing.</li>
<li>Any experience is an opportunity to transcend the quality we want to. We need to maintain a careful balance between <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/2010/life/self-criticism-and-self-encouragement/">self  criticism and self encouragement</a></li>

<blockquote><p><em>“When we are clear in heart and mind—only then shall we find courage  to surmount the fear which haunts the world,”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>- Albert Einstein<br />
</em></p>
<p>When we have worries and problems going around in our mind, we feel like there is a heavy weight holding us down. Sometimes, these mental problems build up slowly and we are not even aware of how much we are struggling to carry around. We can also feel powerless to deal with what we have. These are some tips to keep less on your mind, and to aim for a clearer and sharper mind.</p>
<p><strong>Make A Decision for Each Issue</strong></p>
<p>For each issue that occurs, examine it and then decide what, if anything that you can do. For each issue that comes into your mind, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do Nothing. Some of our worries about other people are beyond our control. Some are things that have not materialised yet. In this case there is nothing we can do. Thinking / worrying about it does not help, so there is no need to pursue it further. Feel free to let go of it completely.</li>
<li>Do it Straight-away. If it is really urgent, or really quick, do it straight away then you can get it out of the way. For example, if you have dirty pots lying on the floor, you can go and clean them in two minutes, then you don&#8217;t have to think about them for the rest of the evening (or get nagged by your wife e.t.c&#8230;)</li>
<li>Make a Plan to Deal with it at a certain time. We can&#8217;t deal with everything at the same time, nor is it efficient. If we have a work related issue, but it in a box for when you return to work. Maybe you need to speak to someone, and until then there is nothing that you can do.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fundamental point is that everything that comes our way, we carefully analyse the best way and best time of dealing with it. It&#8217;s like we have an inbox in our mind, but, we try to keep our inbox clear by either dealing with it straight away or putting it in folder (work, relationships) A folder to be dealt with at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Quite often, we have things going around in our mind which we half heartedly deal with, but don&#8217;t resolve. We have many things which are nagging at our attention, but, we don&#8217;t deal with them straight away. With this method, we can be clearer about when we are going to deal with things.</p>
<p>When we have this clarity, we can be much more focused and at peace withourselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>Each  thought is hopeless and useless<br />
When I am in my unclear mind.<br />
Each thought is prosperous and generous<br />
When I am in my clear mind.</p></blockquote>
<div id="bookexcerpt">- Sri Chinmoy (1)</div>
<p><strong>Pay No Attention to the Speculations of the Mind</strong></p>
<p>Often the mind creates imaginary problems. It speculates on people&#8217;s motives and attitudes towards us, even on the flimsiest of evidence we build up fearful situations. These mental speculations are usually wrong, but, they can take up a lot of negative energy and make our mind feel cluttered.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Take Problems Which are Not Yours</strong></p>
<p>We need to empathise and offer support with friends and family. But, we have to tread a careful line to make sure we don&#8217;t take on problems which are not our own. If we waste energy worrying about problems which are not our own, it will be never ending, as we can&#8217;t even solve them.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Feel Guilty</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; <em>If you want to transform<br />
Your life radically<br />
Then  immediately give up<br />
Your false sense of teeming guilt</em>. &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy (2)</p></blockquote>
<p>What has happened in the past is gone. There is nothing we can do about it. Feeling guilty for past mistakes won&#8217;t help rectify them; however, it will burden us down. If we make a resolution to do the right thing, this is the best approach.</p>
<p>We can definitely keep our minds clearer. We have to be willing to let go of problems, and deal with things at the appropriate time. Either we need to relax or deal with a problem until there is nothing more we can do.</p>
<p><strong>Meditation</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; Clear mind is like the full moon in the sky. Sometimes clouds come  and cover it, but the moon is always behind them. Clouds go away, then  the moon shines brightly. So don&#8217;t worry about clear mind: it is always  there. When thinking comes, behind it is clear mind. When thinking goes,  there is only clear mind.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Zen Master Seung Sahn</p>
<p>Remember we always have a clear mind, it is just that sometimes it gets clouded by thoughts. But, by detaching ourselves from thoughts we can regain our clear mind.</p>
