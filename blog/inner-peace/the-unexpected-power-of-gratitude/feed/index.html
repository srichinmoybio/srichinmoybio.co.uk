		<description><![CDATA[Yes gratitude is a great thing, but it can be practiced with those people who really understand the value of person who shows gratitude, and that is happening in west, where as in India, it is just like &quot; KALE AKSHAR BHES BRBAR&quot; OR &quot; BHESH KE AA GE BEEN BHAJANA&quot;, i.e. shwoing a colourful flower to blind. In india there is no understanding of give and take, the mentality is reverse, if we show gratitude, other consider our weakness or things foolish of us. Can you help with this to me I have faced this thing and have practiced gratitude with real inner heart feelings with my employees, but they have simply considered as my weakness or foolishness and have completely ignored the art of gratitiude.
thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am sure that sense of gratitude brings joy... that is very important in the spiritual path. Without gratitude towards god, nature and fellowbeings,  no pilgrimage can even help to progress. Thats wat I believe...thanks for sharing..

		<description><![CDATA[Commenting about Gratefulness and Gratitude - Have you seen the trailer on the upcoming doug Vermeeren film? (Mr. Vermeeren is the creator of The Opus) The trailer is challenges science and faith one against another in some kind of GRATITUDE EXPERIMENT (www.MMPWmovies.com) as he cals it. I am agnostic and believe that scientific evidence and fact are far too strong to let airy fair new age mumbo jumbo dictate my life... Good luck with that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When you thank God in advance for that which you choose to experience in your reality, you, in effect, acknowledge that it is there...in effect.  Thankfulness is thus the most powerful statement to God; an affirmation that even before you ask, I have answered.
Therefore never supplicate.  Appreciate.
