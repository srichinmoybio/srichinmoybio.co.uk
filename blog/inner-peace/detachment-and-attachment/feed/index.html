		<description><![CDATA[I guess in the realm of cosmic relations nothing is indeed a coincidences but rather a series of connections in ropes already being weaved. 

I am a ugandan Psychology student yet, in my day to life I have found that I have slowly but surely developed an art of &#039;living through love&#039;. At first I tried to rationalise this behavior (oh for the follies of little faith!), but rationale could not explain my ability to let go of past hurts, or to see goodness in people labeled as unlovable, or to rise above personal hurt to recognise and connect with the pain of those that inflict hurt upon me. 

When I first learnt to meditate, I used Jack kornfields cds on loving Kindness and meditations with heart. Little did I know that in those moments, a subliminal influence was planted. Now here am I years later trying to get some research on Attachment theory and detachment in Child development and its later impact on social wellbeing and VOILA! I find a posting or a site or whatever with people of the same mindset. People living positively through love. Is this Karma or was it a coincidence. Friends and like hearts throw me some rope that I may waddle to the shallow end of this deep ocean of life yet not fear the possibilities of being swept right back into the deep end because I am sure that therein lies a force of collective unconscious love just waiting to buoy me on.  I loved reading this Swan and monks story. I shall believe that more is yet to find its way to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you know what? Since here is such a cosy place to post...that swan and the rainbows leave man mute, as a mute swan. and you stay wondering what is about life. day after days being frustrated about money, eventually I though they ruined the happiness of my life, and then I ruined few things around me to get them. like ruined relationship or ruined moment. Since usually i was doing the opposite before. Them they came. The money. And nothing. The precious was gone. Not inside me, not outside me. So watch out! Next time you choose:) The swan is always mute, he will never tell you about that rainbow.]]></description>

Even if you own a lot of money, it may not be likely that you are happy after all. It depends on our mind and attitude, I think. ;-)]]></description>
