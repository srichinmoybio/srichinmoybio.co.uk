		<description><![CDATA[This advice makes common ground but what happens when the anger is justified? What happens when someone uses your ability to remain calm to their advantage? What happens when someone takes pleasure in bullying you, taking advantage of you, or abusing their power over you? I have a hard to believing that in circumstances this advice works. Sometimes it is important to fight back, to draw boundaries, to make clear that no means no in your book. I&#039;m torn with this advice....but that does not mean I don&#039;t find it valuable.]]></description>

I&#039;ve found that acknowledging and working with anger is far healthier than suppressing it which for me led to irrational outbursts. Christopher Nevill also has a book out which you can check out over here: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008KJM3A8]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article, love the way you simply explained the ways to overcome anger, and so practical too. I actually myself had a really bad temper but managed to control it. I also read that if you are angry all the time you are a person with a bad luck: http://pranaworld.net/frequent-anger-brings-bad-luck/ it was actually interesting. thanks again for the great work, keep it up :)]]></description>
