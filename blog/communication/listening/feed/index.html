I have had been practicing this art for last 5 years and have written my experiences at http://joyoflistening.blogspot.com. You may like to view my experiences and experiments on this wonderful gift of nature to us.]]></description>

With some people who are close to me, I can actually ask them if they are expecting a solution to their problem from me. Usually I find that they are just trying to share their feelings and are looking for a sympathetic ear, so I try to keep my advice to myself.]]></description>
