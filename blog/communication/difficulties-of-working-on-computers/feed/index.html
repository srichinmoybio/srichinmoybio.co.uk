		<description><![CDATA[Hey great post there,

The Internet has definitely contributed to the &#039;information overload&#039; that so many of us experience. Addictive, yes it is. 

When I sit down at the computer these days, I make sure that I have a plan of what I want to get done. Otherwise, it is far too easy to jump from link to link and not be productive.

Never before have we had so much information at our finger tips. Are we better for it? Well, as you say it largely depends on what we &#039;do&#039; with the information that we learn. &#039;Applied&#039; knowledge is power, not knowledge that is dormant and unused.

I particularly liked your words near the end...&quot;I think one of the keys to happiness is living in the heart and getting away from the judgmental mind.&quot;

So true. I became a Father for the first time this year and it has opened my heart wider than anything else in my life so far.

After all, love really is the most important thing and the quality of our lives (our happiness) I feel is a reflection of the quality of our relationships, most importantly the relationship we have with ourselves.

Anyway, thanks for sharing. I&#039;ve put your blog in my favourites!]]></description>
