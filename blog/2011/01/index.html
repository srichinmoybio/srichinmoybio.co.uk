<p>As a profession I teach Economics. The first lesson of economics is the concept of scarcity. Because we have scarcity we have to decide how to distribute these limited resources. If you gain some goods, that means less for me. This law of economics we can also feel in all aspects of life.</p>
<p>However, from a spiritual perspective this law is completely misleading. When we give wholeheartedly and with sincerity, we  enable ourselves to have more. If we offer good will to others, if we can give others joy, then this is the best way of being joyful ourselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>Anything we do for the world<br />
Is bound to be returned<br />
Infinitely more.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-631-1' id='fnref-631-1'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>If we think there is only a limited amount of love, we will try and possess it; we will love another, but in a limited and possessive way. With this conception of love, we will always fear losing it; we will fear that our limited love could easily escape. However, if we love unconditionally, if we love everyone we meet, we come to appreciate that it is natural to be loving all the time. To love others, we have to have love for ourselves. This is not an egotistical love; it is a recognition of our divine essence, our real Self. If we feel love and joy to be scarce commodities we will try and ration it and grasp onto it when we see. But, when we learn to give unconditionally, we gain more of what we give. As St Francis of Assisi, concisely put: &#8220;<em>For it is in giving that we receive.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Attitude to Money</strong></p>
<p>If we see others in need and offer financial assistance, we learn the value of giving. This confidence to give to others in need, helps us to attract money into our lives. It is only in cheerfully using money that we can feel wealthy. I used to work for a boss who was a multi-millionaire. However, he was very miserly; he would turn off the heating and lights to save a few pence. He couldn&#8217;t give anything to anyone. He had stacks of money in the bank, but he felt poor. His millions gave no joy because he couldn&#8217;t spend it.</p>
<p><strong>Giving with Sincerity</strong></p>
<p>If we give to others with the hope that we will get in return, this is not sincere joyful giving. When we give with this attitude, there is a fear our giving may not pay dividends. With this attitude, we don&#8217;t really know if we actually have joy to give; it becomes like a bargain. This is not effective. If we give unconditionally, we do not need or expect anything in return. Giving is its own reward. Whether it is misused or not returned doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; because we know that giving selflessly helps us to do and become the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>Learn by Teaching.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Love cannot remain by itself &#8212; it has no meaning.<br />
Love has to be put into action, and that action is service</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Mother Teresa.</p>
<p>I always tell my students that the best way to revise / learn is to teach others. If you just read the same notes, it is hard to make progress. However, if they take time to explain something to others, then there own understanding and comprehension increases significantly. It is the same principle in life, what we teach and give to others is the lessons we will learn ourselves.</p>
<p>If we judge others, we will feel judged ourselves. If we offer happiness to others, we will be happy ourself. If we are miserly towards other people, we will feel miserly ourselves.</p>

<p>I love sport and especially the Olympics. I am a competitive cyclist taking part in races from 1  to 100 miles. Sport gives so much, yet when we see modern sport, we also see many aspects which could be better. These notes may seem idealistic, but sometimes it is good to dream, even if they seem unrealistic at the time. This is what sport means to me.</p>
<p><strong>Sports-like Attitude.</strong></p>
<p>In any sport, there are decisions which can go either way. They present an opportunity to accept decisions with either good grace or bad grace. To many, winning at all costs, justifies berating any decision which goes against you. To accept all decisions with good grace, displays great dignity. It means you can enjoy the game, even if you feel one or two decisions go against you. It means you are putting the sporting ideals above only valuing winning. When we see sportsmen like behaviour, when we see players accepting decisions and accepting defeat with good grace it gives the spectator a lot of joy.</p>
<p>A young General Patton competed in the 1912 Olympic games, in the modern pentathlon (then reserved for army officers). His shots were unfairly judged, but he never complained and wrote about the experience of the Olympics.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The high spirit of sportsmanship and generosity manifested throughout  speaks volumes for the character of the officers of the present day.  There was not a single incident of a protest or any unsportsmanlike  quibbling or fighting for points which I may say, marred some of the  other civilian competitions at the Olympic Games. Each man did his best  and took what fortune sent them like a true soldier, and at the end we  all felt more like good friends and comrades than rivals in a severe  competition, yet this spirit of friendship in no manner detracted from  the zeal with which all strove for success.&#8221;</p>
<p>General Patton</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Amateur Ideal.</strong></p>
<p>There was a time when the Olympics had the  ideal of amateur status. The idea that we competed in sport for pure  sporting ideals and not for any monetary gain. These days some sportsmen  are paid so much money, the spectator feels that money is a key driving  factor. When sport becomes overly commercial it lose a certain  simplicity and purity. Of course, money is not necessarily bad, it  depends how we use it; and some sportsman can remain unaffected by  money. But, when there is big money at stake, our motives are invariably  clouded. To engage in sport without monetary considerations means we  give ourselves to sport and not Mammon. There are probably a hundred  reasons for professional sport. But, when you partake in sport purely  for its own-sake, you get something money can never give.</p>
<p><strong>Respect for Opponent</strong></p>
<p>A sports-like attitude is quite compatible with striving your hardest to win. But, we can seek to be the best without denigrating our opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Transcendence</strong></p>
<p>Only one person can be best in the world. If we only get satisfaction when we are the absolute best, we will never enjoy sport. Self-transcendence is the art of competing with yourself. It is the attempt to better yourself and transcend physical barriers. It is not just about transcending previous physical feats, but also learning about the inner meaning of sport. It is learning to be content even with fluctuations in performance, but striving to transcend our previous efforts. Self-transcendence teaches us to never give up, but persist despite fluctuations in our performance.</p>
<p><strong>Spirituality and Sport</strong></p>
<p>At first glance sport may seem separate to spirituality. But, they can easily go together. With a spiritual approach to sport, we seek to do our best and at the same time accept whatever the result is. From sport we can learn concentration, perseverance,  self-discipline; all qualities that help the inner seeking.</p>
<p><strong>Who is the Winner?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>A great champion is he who wins all the races.</p>
<p>A great champion is he who participates in all the races.</p>
<p>A great champion is he who does not care for the results of the races &#8211; whether he is first or last or in between. He races just to get joy and give joy to the observers.</p>
<p>A great champion is he who transcends his own previous records.</p>
<p>A great champion is he who maintains his standard.</p>
<p>A great champion is he who remains happy even when he cannot maintain his standard.</p>
<p>A great champion is he who has established his inseparable oneness with the winner and the loser alike.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thoughts have power. As we think, so we become. If we allow negative thoughts to dominate our mind, we will be frustrated, unhappy and lacking in inner peace. If we can stop negative thoughts, we will will be able to see the beautiful, even in the mundane; we will be able to attain peace of mind, even in the turmoil of everyday life.</p>
<h3>How To Stop your Negative Thoughts.</h3>
<p><strong>Be Committed</strong></p>
<p>The very first step is simply the awareness that you want to stop your negative thoughts. Unfortunately, there is a part of us that holds on to negative thoughts; if we didn&#8217;t consciously or unconsciously invite negative thoughts we wouldn&#8217;t have them. For example, we sometimes hold onto negative thoughts out of <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/how-to-stop-feeling-sorry-for-yourself/">self-pity</a>; we have to be careful of this. If we strongly value the benefit of rejecting negative thoughts we will be able to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Be Aware.</strong></p>
<p>Another problem is that negative thoughts can often slip in unnoticed. We allow negative thoughts to spiral around in our mind and don&#8217;t have the discipline to reject them. Always be conscious of your thoughts, and don&#8217;t allow your mind to wander down a path of negativity. Feel that when you allow negative thoughts into your mind you are staining something very beautiful. Take time to periodically review your thoughts so that it will become more instinctive to be aware of your own mind.</p>
<p><strong>Positive Visualisation.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Only by our positive thinking,<br />
By our bringing the positive qualities<br />
Of others to the fore,<br />
Will this world be able<br />
To make progress.</p></blockquote>
<div id="bookexcerpt">- Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-622-1' id='fnref-622-1'>1</a></sup></div>
<p>The most effective way for countering negativity, is to throw yourself into the opposite &#8211; which is a positive view of life. Don&#8217;t focus on a person&#8217;s minor misdemeanour&#8217;s, but focus on the real self, the part that is divine. If you are frustrated how society is at the moment, visualise how society can change into something beautiful. By thinking of the positive and by feeling divine qualities of love, we will not want to harbour negativity. Don&#8217;t feel you are fighting negativity, but just growing into a better world-view.</p>
<p><strong>Negativity Hurts yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Much negativity is focused on other people &#8211; colleagues who annoy us, friends who disappoint us, politicians who fail us. We wish to blame and criticise other people we come into contact with. However, as we gain more experience, we come to feel that our own negativity unmistakably returns to its source. The failings we see in others are merely some part of our own larger nature. When we realise that negativity towards others returns like a boomerang, we will naturally be more compassionate, forgiving and loving. By being kind to others, we are really being kind to our more illumined self.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are what we think.<br />
All that we are arises with our thoughts.<br />
With our thoughts we make the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Lord Buddha <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-622-2' id='fnref-622-2'>2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Meditation</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, when sitting down to meditate, I just allow thoughts to pass by and I act as the observer of the thoughts. This allows myself to be aware of the thoughts that I produce; it also enables me to see thoughts as separate from my real self. By simply observing thoughts that pass by your mind, you will be able to see them as passing, transient objects &#8211; separate from yourself. With this perspective it is much easier to reject those you don&#8217;t want.</p>

<p>Our relationship with other people is an intrinsic part of our life, yet, despite its importance, we often repeat the same mistakes throughout our life. If we avoid these mistakes in relationships, we will find them much more harmonious and fulfilling.</p>
<p>Some Common mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Trying to Change the Other</strong></p>
<p>In society we often have an expression ‘When you get married, she’ll make you into a good man…’ At this prospect, we either shudder or laugh; but for many people they find themselves in relationships where there is a persistent attempt to mould and change the other person.  When we try to change another person we invariably create friction and resentment, and push the other person away from us. Also, when we try to change the other person, it is often merely a surrogate for changing our own attitude. The difference is we cannot be responsible for another person, but we can change our own thoughts and behaviour. We can point out certain things, we can try and inspire the other person, but it has to be with the understanding that only he can make the change. Don&#8217;t hold onto the thought that the relationship will be successful, just as soon as you can change the other person; it will never happen.</p>
<p><strong>Possessiveness</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What is love? If love means possessing someone or something then that is not real love; that is not pure love. If love means giving and becoming one with everything, with humanity and divinity, then that is real love. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-612-1' id='fnref-612-1'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>The world is filled with romantic notions that we will love a person for eternity, and nothing will impinge on this love.  We feel that love and joy are limited and we need to protect our access to it. This sense of possessiveness easily creates jealousy and insecurity. We become jealous if anyone gets close. We become insecure we may lose the other person. Possessiveness is not healthy; it restricts relationships and makes them tense. It is important to have confidence in your self. Don’t feel your existence requires the presence of a certain person. You have to feel you are complete with or without other people. It is the nature of all human relationships that they are transitory; they may last one week or ninety years, but ultimately they come and go. All relationships are an opportunity to make progress and know more about ourselves. Don’t worry about holding onto someone, worry about becoming a better person.</p>
<p><strong>Trying to Please</strong></p>
<p>This may seem a paradox because we feel to make a relationship work we need to try and please the other person. Surely, it is good to think of the other person? The problem comes when we have to change who we are in order to try and please them (in the way we think will please him). The first problem is that we feel uncomfortable trying to be someone we are not, and our friend will pick up on this. Also, trying to please the other is difficult because how can we really know what he really wants? This does not mean we act in a selfish way. But, the basis of a good relationship has to be from a starting point of being true to ourself. If we are sincerely happy then we will be able to make the relationship work. If we feel unhappy and ill at ease &#8211; trying to be someone we are not &#8211; then the relationship is based on false pretences and is liable to problems.</p>
<p><strong>Expectation</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Love sought is good, but given unsought is better&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; William Shakespeare, <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-612-2' id='fnref-612-2'>2</a></sup></p>
<p>In human love we give to the other person, but expect something in return. When we love in a divine way, when we love unconditionally, – we give without expecting anything in return. When we give with expectation, we suffer frustration because our expectations are not met. When we love unconditionally, we can be joyful however the other person responds.</p>
<p><strong>Brooding not Communicating</strong></p>
<p>We sometimes feel that relationships should be perfect and any problem is a sign of weakness or failure on our part. Therefore, we tend to try and give the impression everything is fine, when actually it isn’t. This causes us to brood and not communicate. When we brood we inwardly think negative thoughts, and inwardly criticise the other person. This is not healthy as the negative thoughts can go round in circles and reinforce the previous problems.      It is much better to communicate in a constructive way; explain why you feel unhappy for this particular situation. Don’t make the other person feel guilty, but share how your friendship could be improved.  Try to let little things go, but we do need to communicate before our mind magnifies a small issue and becomes a big misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>Judging</strong></p>
<p>When we judge there is a feeling of inferiority or superiority, and guilt or pride. If we spend our time judging, the relationship will never be harmonious.  This doesn’t mean that we can never point out flaws and mistakes; a healthy relationship needs this. However, we can always act in a non-judgemental way. When we point out mistakes we can do it without making the person feel inferior. Rather than judging, our relationship will be made stronger by forgiving.</p>
<blockquote><p>If we really want to love<br />
we must learn how to forgive.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Mother Teresa</p>
<p>When we judge, we separate. Love is a feeling of oneness. We can feel we are just judging ourselves.</p>

	    <p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bowing_figures.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-608" title="bowing_figures" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bowing_figures.jpg" alt="prayer" width="225" /></a></p>
<p>Prayer is said to be an act of communication between yourself and the Divine. It can be expressed in words, feelings or actions. In particular, prayer usually involves requesting a certain boon.  In one sense we are praying all the time, it is just that there are many different levels and types of prayer; we may not even class it as prayer, but just hold various wishes and desires  that we would like to come true.<br />
Prayer can vary from the purely selfish ‘<em>O Lord, won’t you buy me a Mercedez-Benz</em>’ to the lofty utterance of Christ ‘<em>Not my will but thine be done</em>’. Here are some different types of prayer from the lowest to the highest.</p>
<p><strong>Bring Other People Down.</strong></p>
<p>It is a sad fact of human nature that sometimes we are more concerned with bringing people down, and not concentrating on our own upliftment. This kind of prayer is usually motivated out of jealousy or insecurity. Here we wish to see others fail and remain unfulfilled. Usually we wouldn’t dignify this kind of wish with the term prayer, but it may be a belief we secretly hold.</p>
<p><strong>Poor Me Prayer</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Complaint is the largest tribute heaven receives and the sincerest part of our devotion.</p></blockquote>
<p>~Jonathan Swift</p>
<p>Another type of prayer is to half wish for something, but have a strong feeling we don’t deserve to get it. For example, we may pray to have successful relationships with other people, but at the same time we hold thought patterns that are self-destructive for relationships. We pray for harmony in our dealing with others, but lack the self-belief and inner happiness to make it a reality. Here we would be better of praying to overcome the root cause and not merely a symptom. It also brings to mind the old Indian proverb</p>
<blockquote><p>Call on God, but row away from the rocks</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, it is good to pray, but we also have to make sure we avoid having the wrong attitude.</p>
<p><strong>Material Wealth</strong></p>
<p>This is a simple prayer for material wealth, and success in the outer life.  We feel that, if only, we can get that car, new job or material security then we will be happy. This is the kind of prayer that may or not be answered. But, the richest person on earth may be completely bankrupt of inner peace. It is often the case that when we get a new car, it isn’t long before we would like the next best model or another car; there is no end to this kind of prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Pray for Health.</strong></p>
<p>Often humans only pray when we are in great danger. Bad luck and bad health is a powerful reminder that even the most powerful person on earth can’t be entirely self-sufficient. To pray for good health is good. When we are sick and suffering, we tend to be more unhappy; to have good health helps us to be in a better consciousness and make progress. However, we can never know or not whether this prayer will work. Sometimes our soul may want to have certain experiences, sometimes it may be God’s Will for someone to leave the body. We cannot stay on earth forever. To make progress, the soul may need to depart the body. Therefore, it is best to pray for good health and a long life, but also with detachment. We pray to be healthier, but if we cannot regain full health we should also pray for the right attitude to deal with the illness. Then our physical illness can be an opportunity to make progress and not just a source of frustration.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Qualities.</strong></p>
<p>This is a prayer for inner qualities. It is not for anything in the material world. But, for peace, love and joy. It is a prayer to be aware of our deeper sense of self. It is a prayer of spiritual aspiration that will help us face any situation we are in.</p>
<p><strong>Meditation</strong></p>
<p>In prayer we speak to God, and try to ask for something; there is a feeling we lack and need more. In <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/an-introduction-to-meditation/">meditation</a>, we list to God. We keep our mind and emotions still, we try to be aware of the vast Consciousness within. In a way meditation is a form of prayer because we are selflessly growing into that which we would pray. Prayer and meditation are like two sides of the same coin, each ultimately going to the same destination.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When we pray, we ask God for what we want. But when we meditate, God showers on us everything that we need.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-607-1' id='fnref-607-1'>1</a></sup><br />
<strong> Not my will but thine be done.</strong></p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy says the loftiest prayer was uttered by the Saviour Christ ‘Not my will but thine be done.’ [Luke 22:42]  In this prayer we wish to become one with God’s will, with God’s consciousness. It is an awareness that if we can become one with our Source, then we will lack for nothing and all our prayers will be answered. We tend to be nervous of wholeheartedly offering this prayer. We feel that God’s Will will impinge on our freedom, but the great mystics and saints teach that only when we attain self-realisation, (Nirvana, God Realisation, Salvation) can we really experience the real bliss of being.</p>
<blockquote><p>They say that prayer is the daughter of suffering.<br />
But I say that prayer is the mother of delight</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>

	    <p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/long-drive.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-602" title="long-drive" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/long-drive.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Often we feel powerless, a victim of circumstances. Yet, other people seem &#8216;lucky&#8217; they are able to attract fortunate events and positive people. On some level, we do have much creative power. Unfortunately, we are using this creative energy in a negative way, creating difficult relationships and difficult circumstances. Yet, we can create much better circumstances if we try.</p>
<p><strong>Feel it is Possible.</strong></p>
<p>We need to have faith a better world is possible. If we have faith in negativity &#8211; that will be our experience. If we have faith in a positive experience, then we will be able to experience that.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though       nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">&#8211; <em>Albert       Einstein</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Choosing To Be Happy.</strong></p>
<p>Having faith in a better life is also choosing to have positive experiences. We constantly have a choice of how we react to events and how we think. One way will give us more joy than another, yet for certain reasons we don&#8217;t always choose the attitude that gives happiness. Therefore we need to make a clear and conscious decision to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>Constant Practise.</strong></p>
<p>It is not enough to say on one occasion &#8211; &#8216;I&#8217;d like to have better circumstances&#8217;. This single, positive (and rather feeble) thought will soon be outweighed by the countless negative thoughts and negative expectations that we will have. It is like a weighing scale, at the least, we need more positive thoughts and feelings than negative thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude. </strong></p>
<p>The great saints and mystics frequently talk about the spontaneous gratitude they feel. The mystic sees the beauty and joy in the world. By being grateful to the joyful and beautiful, we are able to attract exactly that. Soulful <a href="http://www.shortpoems.org/poems/gratitude_poems.html">gratitude</a> has tremendous creative power. Also, don’t just be grateful for what you have experienced, be grateful for the beautiful things you will experience.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivate the Beautiful and Good</strong></p>
<p>If we try to fight negativity by negation, we can go around in circles. If we constantly think &#8216;I must stop being a negative person&#8217; we can reinforce the impression of our own negativity. It is much better to visualise and concentrate on becoming a positive and kind person.</p>
<p><strong>Uplift Others.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I am very happy<br />
Because I have conquered myself<br />
And not the world.</p>
<p>I am very happy<br />
Because I have loved the world<br />
And not myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>We will never create better circumstances at the expense of others. If we feel we will be happier by embarrassing and criticising other people, this is not a real improvement in happiness. It is a false happiness that relies on success at the expense of others. The easiest way to make our circumstances better is to be a more thoughtful and caring person. When we put others well being above our own, we learn to be selfless and this gives a sense of true happiness. This does not mean we have to go around giving money to street beggars. Our service to be others shouldn&#8217;t be ostentatious. We give most help by merely offering our good will and looking for the best in others.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Judgemental</strong></p>
<p>We make life hard by being so judgemental. We should be less judgemental and be more of an observer. We should observe if we like a part of ourselves. If we notice we are prone to depression or anger, make the conscious decision to reject that part of yourself. See it as a passing emotion that doesn&#8217;t reflect your true self, instead choose something positive.</p>
<p><strong>Meditate and Concentrate</strong></p>
<p>Thought has great power. But, silence has even more power. If we can still the mind and enter into silence, we can get in touch with the deeper part of our self. This silent self has a connection to the underlying cosmic spirit, and this is the most effective way to create a more fulfilling and positive experience.</p>
