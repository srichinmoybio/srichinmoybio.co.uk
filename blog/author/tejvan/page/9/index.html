<p>The modern world with its many fascinations, distractions and temptations can give us many things, but the humblest of all goals &#8211; our own inner peace &#8211; seems the one illusive thing beyond our reach. Yet, to attain inner peace it is not necessary to go back in time or visit the timeless Himalayan caves. Peace is perfectly compatible with modern life, if we learn how to harness the values of peace to the dynamism of modern life.</p>
<p><strong>Peace In the Stress of Life</strong></p>
<p>Often I hear people say &#8216;I don&#8217;t have time to develop peace&#8217;. They have a vague idea peace may be gained if only they could win the lottery and retire from work.  It is a misconception that inner peace needs to be associated with an inactive life. We can often find inner peace through a purposeful life, a life of serving others. If we wallow in our own lethargy, we will never cultivate inner peace. Inner peace we don&#8217;t get from watching TV, at best it may give us a slight sense of relaxation, but not an abiding sense of satisfaction. Inner peace comes from a feeling of living a purposeful life. If we are unhappy, we will not gain peace.</p>
<p><strong>Doing Our Best.</strong></p>
<p>We put ourselves under great pressure. We want to try and keep everyone happy. But, inevitably it is impossible to keep everyone happy and always succeed in doing well. We have to judge ourselves on our motives and intentions &#8211; not the external outcome or what other people think. If we work with the right attitude, doing the best in difficult circumstances &#8211; what else can we do? Don&#8217;t allow the unreasonable expectations of others to disturb your inner peace. If we can work with this sense of detachment then we will avoid many feelings of guilty, worry and anxiety. It is these forces that disturb own inner peace.</p>
<p>Inner peace can never be dependent upon outer success and outer praise. It is the nature of the world to give success / failure, praise / blame in equal measure. We have to transcend this at be at peace with ourselves whatever happens.</p>
<p>One of the great spiritual texts &#8211; The Bhagavad Gita,  was given in the middle of a war (Battle of Kurushetra). Sri Krishna advised Arjuna:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do your duty to the best of your ability, O Arjuna,<br />
With your mind attached to the Lord,<br />
Abandoning (worry and) attachment to the results,<br />
And remaining calm in both success and failure.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Simplify.</strong></p>
<p>It is true we don&#8217;t need to live in austerity or a Himalayan cave to cultivate inner peace. But, it is equally true, that we can easily minimise the pressures and inconsequential distractions that are readily available in modern life. Modern technology has given us unprecedented access to technology and communication. Undoutedely this has benefits if used wisely. But, sometimes it is like getting a glass of water standing under the Niagra falls. In other words we can become overwhelmed with information and this can become almost addictive. Similarly we can spend hours sending short messages or doing small things. We become reluctant to switch off from the electronic world and spend time enjoying the simpler pressures of life.</p>
<p>There are many ways to simplify our life (see: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/10-effective-ways-to-simplify-your-life/">10 ways to simplify your life</a>) . &#8211; Getting rid of junk, spending less time on checking email, taking time to ourselves; but this simplicity is often feared in modern society because we have become so used to absorbing out attention in external distractions. We need to disentangle from some of these to be able to cultivate peace.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts.</strong></p>
<p>To gain inner peace, we must learn to control our thoughts. It is our own thoughts which can take us to heaven or hell &#8211; no matter where we are on earth. We have to reject thoughts of jealousy, pride and insecurity. If we, even subconsciously, cherish these emotions then peace will be a far cry. It is when we cultivate good / uplifting thoughts that we can avoid the mental disturbance that is so harmful to inner peace.(<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/how-to-gain-control-of-your-own-thoughts/">How to control thoughts</a>)</p>
<p>Another issues which is always very important is the idea that we have to want inner peace &#8211; it is only when we truly value the life of peace that we will work to make it happen. If we don&#8217;t value inner peace &#8211; how can we expect to have a peaceful life?</p>
<p><strong>Real Peace</strong></p>
<p>If we avoid negative thoughts and negative emotions; if we simplify our life and take a compassionate attitude to ourselves and others, we will definitely have a more peaceful life. But, to experience a very deep and abiding sense of peace, we need to go beyond the thought world and awaken the silence within.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>To come back to the secret of <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">inner</span> <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">peace</span>, our questioning and doubting mind is always wanting in <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">peace</span>. Our loving and dedicated heart is always flooded with <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">inner</span> <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">peace</span>. If our mind has all the questions, then our heart has all the answers.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>- Sri Chinmoy<br />
</em></p>
<p>It is this quiet part of ourselves, that is the real secret of inner peace. We cannot experience this silent peace, through philosophy or talking. It can only be brought to the fore by a silent mind and open heart. In concentration and <a href="http://www.freemeditationlondon.co.uk/">meditation</a>, we learn to silence the endless stream of thought and awaken this peaceful consciousness.</p>
<p>We might gain a glimpse of this kind of peace when we are lost in the marvels of nature or listening to the most profound music. But, to gain an easy access to the real inner peace, meditation is by far the most effective strategy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/an-introduction-to-meditation/">Introduction to meditation</a></p>
<p><strong>It is all in the Mind.</strong></p>
<p>There was a great sage who spent many years meditating in a cave. Over the years he developed tremendous inner peace through his meditation. Once a great King came to visit and spoke to the sage about the turmoils of his earthly kingdom. The sage asked the King why not come and meditate with me in the cave &#8211; Then you can have peace. The king replied &#8211; what would the use be? If I came here, I would still be thinking of my Kingdom &#8211; I would be building imaginary castles in the sky. The King, at least, realised the route to peace lay in his mind and no where else.</p>
<p>There is another story about the great King Janaka who lived in ancient India. He ruled over a large Kingdom but was detached from his own world wealth and power. Once he was sitting with his Guru and several followers. When news came of severe weather, everyone rushed back to look after their possessions. But, King Janaka who had by far the most possessions remained unmoved. He was untouched by worry over his material possessions. He preferred to sit at the feet of his Guru. We may only have a few dollars in our pocket, but, if we spend all our time worrying about our material possessions we will not have inner peace.</p>

<p>There is an old saying &#8220;If you want something done, ask a busy person. &#8221; There is a lot of truth in this. Sometimes, we struggle to do anything productive &#8211; even if we have time on our hands. But, at other times we can do alot because we prepare, are focused and do it with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>There are several small things that can make a big difference to how successful we become. These are some tips to help get things done.</p>
<p><strong>Be Clear What you Want to do.</strong></p>
<p>It might seem a rather obvious point, but if we are not clear what we want to do &#8211; how can we do it effectively? I have a student who always talks of giving up smoking. Half of him wants to stop, but the other half enjoys it. If you want to do something difficult like give up smoking you have to be 100% committed. If you do something but are holding onto reservations, you will not be fully committed and so it will be much harder, if not impossible. Too often we drift along with vague ideas we should be doing something; we hold a certain guilt for not doing it, but, we fail to clearly resolve to take action &#8211; so it gets left on the back burner.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Out the Junk.</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles to being productive is getting distracted by small silly things. Having a tidy / clear workspace makes a big difference to being able to work with great focus. Entering a clear, simple work environment gives a definite subconscious psychological boost. Just try tidying your workspace, ruthless clearing out the junk and pieces of paper &#8211; you will definitely notice the difference. We have a rather romantic view of the eccentric genius working in paper strewn mess coming up with complex equations. But, for most of us, working in this kind of environment makes it much more difficult to do anything. Investing 10 minutes to create a clear workspace is a good investment of time.</p>
<p><strong>Do One Thing at A Time</strong></p>
<p>It is not possible to do more than one thing at a time and be focused. Our attention gets split and we struggle to do either effectively. This doesn&#8217;t just mean physically doing only one thing at a time; it also means having our thoughts focused on one particular task. When writing an essay, we need to ignore other thoughts of what we will be doing tomorrow. There is no benefit in worrying over things that we have no control.</p>
<p><strong>Be in the Right Environment</strong></p>
<p>As we have mentioned in previous points, the real secret for getting things done is being 100% committed and focused. Another thing that can help is getting into the right environment. For example, if you need to work at home, create a suitable space for your work. If you carry your laptop into the lounge in front of the TV, you can get easily distracted. Even changing clothes can make a difference. Sometimes, I wander out into the garden in my slippers and start half-heartedly gardening.  When you do something be in the right space, environment and with the right tools / equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Prioritise</strong></p>
<p>The art of getting things done doesn&#8217;t mean we have to be a permanent hive of activity, business and stress. The problem is that we are often &#8216;busy&#8217; doing unimportant and inconsequential things. We need to make a list (either written or mental) of what needs doing and doing the most pressing things first, even if it is not necessarily the most pleasant.</p>
<p>Feel that whatever you do there is an opportunity cost. If we spend time flicking through tv channels it means we don&#8217;t have time for something more fulfilling and worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>Finish what you start.</strong></p>
<p>The hardest thing with getting things done is often just getting started. It takes a mental effort to get started, so once we overcome this barrier try finishing it in one go. If we keep stopping and starting we will waste precious time and loose focus. Where possible try to benefit from economies of scale. e.g. rather than checking emails several times throughout the day, set aside one or two times to answer and deal with your inbox. This is more efficient than responding piecemeal to incoming messages. (and often when you are trying to do something else as well.)</p>
<p><strong>Read the Instruction manual</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit of novelty in our ipod generation, but so many times I try to do something without any preparation, make it worse and then have to go back to read the instruction manual. Good preparation can save a lot of heartache and wasted effort. Jumping straight in without any clear plan isn&#8217;t usually the best way to get something done.</p>
<p><strong>Be Enthusiastic for what you do.</strong></p>
<p>If we can always maintain enthusiasm for what we do, our enthusiasm will carry us through all obstacles and problems. This is a real secret of getting things done.</p>

<h3>Using Music For Meditation</h3>
<p>I often use music whilst meditating. It has to be music composed and performed in a meditative consciousness. It is not the music that excites and stimulates, but the music that inspires us to dive deep within.</p>
<p>Music can be useful if you meditate in a noisy environment (e.g. student flat) The right kind of music can also help still the mind.</p>
<p>The power of soulful / spiritual / meditative music is that it has the capacity to awaken our inner aspiration. It is this inner cry that is the most important aspect of meditation.</p>
<p>Meditation and music is quite a personal choice, but it is well worth exploring.</p>

<p>A while back I tried a period of not criticising people, it was an interesting experiment, if rather difficult. In a similar vein I thought it would be interesting to see what life is like if we make zero complaints about anything.</p>
<p>We tend to be chronic complainers. We complain about other people, about our work situation, about what is on telly, the fact Gas prices have risen 15%; we complain about what is happening in our life, in our house and around the world. There seems no end in sight to our long list of complaints.</p>
<p>Living without complaining is not burying our head in the sand thinking the world has no problems. The crucial question is &#8211; what does complaining achieve? How does constant complaining affect our own life? Does complaining about things we have no control help in any way?</p>
<p><strong>You Can&#8217;t Change The World But You Can Change Yourself.</strong></p>
<p>The road to inner peace is never dependent on ironing out all the problems of society and the world first. Governments will always be making bad decisions, buses will always be arriving late, and electronic devices will always be breaking down. If we write down what we most like to complain about, these will probably not change. Some people think that &#8211; only if they could move country all their complaints will vanish; but, this is wishful thinking, the problems will be there in other countries just in other forms.</p>
<p>The important thing is to change our attitude. Rather than complain, we can tolerate mistakes of others; rather than complain over silly things, we can maintain an attitude of detachment. We need to love and accept the world as it is. We cannot wait for the world to be perfect before we love. The important thing is to be positive &#8211; looking for the good rather than looking for legitimate complaints.</p>
<p><strong>Complaining v Gratitude</strong></p>
<p>When we complain we look for the negative. We give power to our negative thoughts and the world seems a darker place. If we look for the positive, if we aspire to cultivate gratitude for the good in life &#8211; our outlook will completely change. We will give power, focus and attention to the good and beautiful. We constantly have choices &#8211; either complain or be grateful, only ourselves can make this choice.</p>
<p><strong>Complaining and Mistreatment.</strong></p>
<p>There is a great scene in Fawlty Towers (Waldorf Salad I think) &#8211; Two old ladies are served some grizzly old meat; it&#8217;s so overcooked they can barely eat it. When Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) asks if they are enjoying their meal they fake a smile and say &#8216;O, yes Lovely&#8217; But, as soon as he turns his back they screw up their face and spit out the meat. They then start complaining to each other about how bad it is. It is said this is a typical English and Canadian trait &#8211; we don&#8217;t stand up to bad service. We don&#8217;t say anything outwardly, but we bitterly complain inwardly. This reluctance to complain outwardly has not helped; it just means we complain silently and nurse our grievance. If we have a legitimate grievance it is good to politely and calmly express it. It gives chance for the other person to rectify their bad service and it means we are less likely to nurse a perpetual grievance over the overcooked steak a la Fawlty Towers. What we are trying to avoid is the perpetual inner complaining.</p>
<p><strong>Complaining over Things we Have No Control.</strong></p>
<p>There are many things in life which are unjust, unfair and unpleasant. We tend to be drawn to to the negative things we see around us and instinctively we start to complain about everything that is wrong. But, our complaints do not make an iota of difference. They do not change the problem, we just become depressed at the problems in life. There is a big difference between complaining and doing something about it. The old maxim &#8216;actions speak louder than words&#8217; is oft repeated but, there is much wisdom in that saying. Complaining is essentially a negative act with no positive energy to change things.</p>
<p><strong>Complaints are Often misinformed.</strong></p>
<p>Often we complain but we maybe complain on false premises. We love to complain about higher taxes, but, if we didn&#8217;t have higher spending on public services like education and health care, we would be complaining about that. &#8211; It&#8217;s easy to complain, it&#8217;s more difficult to do something about it.</p>
<p>Another example. We may complain about a difficult person. However, that person could be forcing us to face up to our own weaknesses. Often when we dislike some thing about another person their fault exists in our own nature. Rather than complaining we have to learn to deal with difficult people; it may be an opportunity in disguise.</p>
<p><strong>Complaints Don&#8217;t Solve Anything</strong></p>
<p>If we tell the waiter the tea is cold, he can heat it up. But, most of our complaints do nothing to solve anything. We complain about the amount of litter on the street, but, do we ever pick up any litter? We can complain until we are blue in the face about the state of the economy and the government, but this will do nothing to make our life better. If we spent the same energy from complaints into something positive, we would have a chance to make a significant improvement to our life and people around us.</p>
<p>Complaining is essential a negative non-constructive activity which focuses us to focus on the negativity, it also often embodies a feeling of powerlessness.</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you want<br />
To be happy,<br />
Learn the beautiful art<br />
Of self-encouragement.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>It is a fine balance between self encouragement and self-criticism. To honestly evaluate ourselves is a difficult task. We tend to either conveniently ignore our own faults or become too harsh on ourselves for small inconsequential things. We need a balance of self-encouragement and honest self-appraisal; getting the right balance is not so easy.</p>
<h2>Tips for Self Criticism</h2>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Be Ashamed of your Faults.</strong></p>
<p>If we can&#8217;t be honest with ourself who can we be honest with? The mind can be good at justifying our wrong actions and behaviour. But, clever self-justification is of no benefit in the long run. If we can be aware of our own pride, jealousy, insecurities then we have a chance to let go of them. But, if we always justify our wrong attitudes to ourself then we are lost.<br />
<strong><br />
Avoid Guilt</strong>.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we may seek to ignore our faults is that we feel guilty. Rather than feeling guilty we avoid criticising ourself. However, it is better to be self-critical without feelings of guilt. Guilt is an emotion that doesn&#8217;t help but makes us feel more inadequate. Become aware of what you want to change and see it is a positive movement.</p>
<blockquote><p>Not self-contempt<br />
But self-improvement<br />
Has to be<br />
Our continuous choice.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Judge By The Values of Others.</strong></p>
<p>The biggest problem is that we start to judge ourselves by the standards of others. Our friends may have been put out because of something we did. Therefore, they try to make us feel guilty. Because others are critical of us, we feel obliged to feel guilty too. But, we have to be firm and reject others&#8217; criticisms &#8211; if they are not justified. In the eyes of the world we may have done something wrong. But, only we know our inner attitude. We may have done something with the best of intentions and motivations, but, because of circumstances beyond our control, thing turn out badly. The world will criticise us, but, we know we did our best. How can we criticise ourselves for bad luck or circumstances beyond our control?</p>
<ul>
<li>At the same time, we may get praise when we don&#8217;t deserve it.</li>
<li>Also, although we shouldn&#8217;t accept the misinformed critisims of others. We should be open to the suggestions of others. Often people can see things about ourselves that we can&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t be too proud to take advice / suggestions / criticism from others. It is not a sign of weakness to listen to other people. Our sincerity will know whether they are telling the truth or not.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Judge Motives rather than Outcome</strong>.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous point it is our inner attitude which is important. A small action done selflessly without expectation of reward is worth more than egoistic selfish actions which may appear to have a better outcome. It is our inner attitude that we need to be aware of.</p>
<p><strong>Remain Balanced. </strong></p>
<p>When we start to criticise ourself it is easy to lose a sense of proportion and start beating ourselves up over a small issue.  This is a real mistake. We might make small mistakes but, making them into big problems just makes the situation worse. Never lose a sense of proportion and don&#8217;t magnify small problems. At the same time don&#8217;t be dismissive of actions that are causing pain to others.</p>
<p><strong> Self Criticism and Self Encouragement.</strong></p>
<p>Focusing on the negative doesn&#8217;t help. The most effective self-criticism is to also learn the art of self-encouragement. Be aware of the good selfless deeds and thoughts you have and give these more importance. If we strengthen our good qualities then this will take care of most of our weaknesses. The positive approach is by far the best way to help our self-improvement.</p>

<p>People are a mixture of qualities and personalities. At various times, we all embody these different aspects and qualities. But often some quality or trait is more predominant than others. Some friends will be insecure and shy, others will be brash and egocentric. We need to respond to these different characteristics in different ways. There are also some general tips for <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/7-effective-ways-for-dealing-with-difficult-people/">dealing with difficult people here</a>.</p>
<p>Dealing with difficult people is certainly one of the most important life skills and as painful as it maybe, dealing with difficult people can be very instructive. Even if it is just learning &#8211; don&#8217;t be like them!</p>
<p><strong>Ego Centric.</strong></p>
<p>An ego centric person tends to talk alot &#8211; often about themselves and their achievements, They look for compliments and so will often compliment others to encourage praise for themselves. They dislike any criticism and are often insecure, though they hide this insecurity by trying to display their successes. Ego centric people can be a bit of a bore, but, it will not help to point out their shortcomings as they will not appreciate your intervention. It is best to offer sincere praise if justified, but, not to encourage them excessively. If they really are talking too much about themselves, politely but firmly steer the conversation onto something else.<br />
Very insecure and egocentric people will try to put down other people to make themselves feel better. This is pretty frustrating but, before taking it personally, it is worth being aware of why they are doing it so don&#8217;t take it to heart.</p>
<p>There is a saying &#8216;pride comes before a fall.&#8217; If you feel someone&#8217;s ego is ballooning out of control, don&#8217;t despair or worry too much. Sooner or later they are sowing their own downfall.</p>
<p><strong>Opinionated</strong></p>
<p>Opinionated people have strongly held views and tend to be quite confrontational. Whatever the issue it is &#8211; the price of bread, the best place to put the flower pot, the cause of the credit crunch &#8211; you can guarantee they will have a strong opinion and they will vigourously argue for their point of view and won&#8217;t be particularly interested in anyone else&#8217;s opinion. On many issues you can side step them. After all, there are few things in life worth really worth arguing about &#8211; so just avoid bringing up the topics that they will give their interminable lectures on. It is also worth remembering you are probably not going to be able to change their mind directly.</p>
<p>The problem comes when they have a strongly held opinion on something which is important and that you can&#8217;t just ignore. This is maybe an issue which affects you or people around you. It is difficult because they are usually quite set in their ways. The best tactic is not to challenge them head on. Don&#8217;t start by saying I think you are wrong as they will resent this direct challenge. Try looking for some area of agreement and consensus; get them in a good frame of mind and then suggest an improvement or different way of doing things. But, there is no one particular way of dealing with this issue. Sometimes, we just have to be firm. Just because someone is opinionated and will throw a tantrum if they don&#8217;t get their way doesn&#8217;t mean we have to give into them. Never feel guilty for standing upto some behaviour that is wrong. But, where possible make it as least confrontational as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Shy / Insecurity.</strong></p>
<p>Someone who is shy and insecure will be reluctant to come forwards, they will lack confidence and often try hard to please people, even if inwardly they regret doing this. It is important to bear in mind that shy people will need encouragement and support. Small steps to boost their confidence will make a big difference. Don&#8217;t be patronising but give people the opportunity to speak and be true to themselves. Shy people are often quite self critical so there is little need to make a big deal out of criticising small misdemeanour&#8217;s. The main thing is that they will respond positively to even small amounts of encouragement.</p>
<p><strong>Lazy People</strong></p>
<p>Lazy people don&#8217;t create so much problems, but, laziness can become selfish when you have to do their work for them. Try giving them a sense of duty and make them aware of how they impact on other people. They might not change for themselves but, they may become less lazy when they realise others have to carry the can.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Adversity makes you dynamic.<br />
Adversity endow you<br />
With faith in yourself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>Adversity and difficulties are an inescapable part of life. To try and hide from adversity can never work. Whatever we do we will face challenges and and adversity. The important thing is not what happens to you but how we accept and deal with it.</p>
<p>When adversity Strikes these are some tips for dealing with it.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Give Up</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we take difficulties as a sign to give up or &#8216;it is not meant for us&#8217; But, if we look at people who have achieved great things, almost invariably they recovered from initial set backs. The great Abraham Lincoln had so many set backs before becoming US President. (Lost job<br />
Defeated for state legislature (1832), Failed in business (1833), Had nervous breakdown(1936) Defeated for Senate (1854,1858) Yet he became one of the most influential presidents of all time. If at first we don&#8217;t succeed we need to have faith in our goal and keep going.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Blame Others / the Situation</strong></p>
<p>When things go wrong we are apt to blame other people and other situations. The blame game may help us feel a little bit better, but, it doesn&#8217;t help us deal with the adverse forces we are faced with. Really successful people don&#8217;t have time to blame the situation as this can easily encourage a sense of self-pity that is not helpful. We have to take where we are and do what we can to improve our situation. Rather than complaining, if we focus on what we can do we will be much more effective.</p>
<p><strong>Learn From Adversity.</strong></p>
<p>It may be a bit of a cliche, but, it really is difficult situations which give us a great opportunity for self-improvement. If life was easy we would  just become complacent and too laid back. It is adversity that forces us to re-evaluate our pre-conceived ideas and ingrained habits. Adversity is the shock that can lead to a deeper and more thoughtful attitude. If we see adversity as a necessary event for our own self-improvement half the fear of adversity is lost. We no longer see the difficult situation as our enemy but as part of our life.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Worry</strong></p>
<p>We cannot change things beyond our control, so why worry over the inevitable? One of the difficult aspects of adverse situations is the uncertainty and worry that can accompany a deterioration in events. Maybe we worry over our financial situation. But, we shouldn&#8217;t let the worry get out of control and become excessive. Rather than using our mental energy for worrying about things over which we have no control, if we use this energy for doing what we can, our situation will definitely improve.</p>
<p><strong>Detachment</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the last point, detachment helps to be less depressed by the difficulties we face. The worst response is to feel guilty because of difficulties that have arrived. There is only so much we can do when faced with certain situations. We should judge our inner response not the outcome. Sometimes we can be our own worst critic and blame ourselves for things beyond our control. If we have difficulties with the attitude of friends and family &#8211; what can we do? Our responsibility is to do the right thing and respond with a compassionate attitude. But, we cannot change others or make bad situations disappear. Don&#8217;t feel bad for things that are beyond our control.</p>

<p>One of our great challenges in life is to avoid negativity &#8211; a negative attitude to ourselves and others. It is easy to become suspicious, critical, depressed, fearful, but, despite the prevailing attitudes of the world there is no inevitability that we have to become a grumpy old man. It is quite possible to see the beautiful in the ordinary and bring to the fore the better side of human nature. If we avoid negativity we will see definitely see the positive in life and enjoy life much more.</p>
<p><strong>Criticise Not</strong></p>
<p>Criticising others is a very pervasive bad habit we all have. Sometimes we can actually go out of our way to look for the failings and faults of others. It is as if we are blind to their good qualities but their mistakes stand out in our mind. Even worse we can often imagine faults that others might have. This is the height of stupidity, but the nature of the mind can easily turn to negativity and we have to be on guard.</p>
<p>It is a great exercise to try and think about the good aspects of people whom you frequently criticise. The important thing is that criticising others has an unmistakeable impact on ourselves. If we are permanently finding fault with the world it affects our self.</p>
<blockquote><p>To deliberately criticise<br />
Another individual<br />
May cause an indelible stain<br />
On the critic.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>The world will not collapse if we halt our self styled criticism. If we look to encourage and praise the good aspects of others, we will bring these qualities to the fore in ourself.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing Consciously</strong></p>
<p>All the time we are faced with choices. Do I see the negative or the positive? Somebody at work might pass a thoughtless and disparaging comment. Our instinctive reaction may be to nurse a sense of grievance and think of many equally unpleasant things to say about the person in return. However, another way to look at this situation would be to think. They are unfortunately wrong, perhaps they are feeling insecure and so try to unfairly put others down. In the past there may have been times when I may have done something like that. I will make an effort to be kind to that person as this will be the best way to show they were mistaken and also to help them overcome their depressed state of mind.</p>
<p>The first response invites a tit for tat response which will encourage negativity. The second response is dignified and requires nobility of character. But, we lose nothing by avoiding negativity &#8211; we gain a tremendous amount. The point is we always have a choice about how we respond to situations; avoiding the negative and unpleasant just takes a conscious decision.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Belief</strong></p>
<p>It is vital to cultivate a sense of self-worth and self-respect. If we do not have faith in ourselves how can we have faith in anyone else? Self-belief should not be equated with arrogance or pride. We are seeking to cultivate a sense of self respect so we are at peace with ourselves. We are often our worst critic, sometimes we ignore genuine faults but worry excessively over minor issues that aren&#8217;t really faults. We need to learn from our mistakes and be honest with our weaknesses but it should not be at a cost of putting ourselves down. If we make a mistake learn to let go, don&#8217;t keep the negative memory at the forefront of your mind. If we can have a good feeling about ourselves it will be very easy to have a good feeling about others and the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong></p>
<p>Idleness is the worst cultivator of negativity. If we sit mopping aimlessly around we will inevitable become bored and negative. Life will seem no fun. The easiest way to change our mindset is to become meaningfully busy. As we mentioned in this story about &#8216;<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/story/helping-an-alcoholic/">helping an alcoholic&#8217;</a> it was only when the alcoholic helped other people that he was able to overcome his personal weaknesses. If we really want to serve others there will always be some way that we can find. If we are really busy we will not have time to criticise the world. If we don&#8217;t have work to do, we can also just take physical exercise. This is also an excellent way of shaking off the cobwebs of our mind.</p>
<p>Osmosis.</p>
<p>The nature of the human mind is that it consciously or unconsciously absorbs the vibrations from around us. If we spend time with negative people, watching 24 hour news, then we will be more prone to negativity ourselves. We have to choose our work, leisure time carefully. Don&#8217;t spend too much time with  the grumpy old men or gossipy old ladies. When we do spend time with negative people we need to be on our guard that we don&#8217;t share their world view.</p>
<p>Be young At Heart.</p>
<p>I have already made two references to &#8216;grumpy old men&#8217; this is not an ageist remark. You can be a grumpy old man when you are 20. You can be 80 years old but remain young at heart. Age is very much something of a mental attitude. We want to cultivate a childlike attitude which takes joy from small, simple, beautiful things. We want to avoid a great sophistication and mental disection of everything. If we over analyse life we are living in the mind and unable to live in the heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to have a son who sat around doing nothing, but then he took up meditation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a rather feeble new Age joke, but, the idea of doing nothing sounds rather shocking, yet doing nothing can be one of the most rewarding things. Here doing nothing doesn&#8217;t mean loafing away, idly passing time. Doing nothing means the willingness to switch off from external distractions and worries. It means being happy to be in our present surroundings and at peace with ourself.</p>
<p><strong>Time to Yourself</strong></p>
<p>We spend time looking after our family, commuting to work; we work 8 hours a day for a boss. Why do we find it so difficult to spend 15 &#8211; 20 minutes to ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Be Afraid of Silence</strong></p>
<p>We have become afraid of our own selves, and afraid of silence. We have become accustomed to absorbing ourselves in external distractions, often looking at a screen. Because, we never spend time with ourselves we become frightened of what we might find. Real silence is relaxing and reinvigorating. We need to learn to be at peace with ourselves. We must avoid the temptation to start judging ourselves and other people but, just be in peace.</p>
<p><strong>Less is More</strong></p>
<p>We often have a feeling that we need to try and control everything. We need to change others behaviour, we need to change ourselves, we need to change the world. We expend alot of energy ruminating over the failings of others and what they ought to do. Often this is just on a mental level. Our thoughts are filled with what other people should do and why they are bad. But, in many cases we would be better off for minding our own business. There are many things that we are not responsible for, especially when it comes to changing other people. We can inspire them and lead by example, but, sometimes we need to allow people to make their own choices and follow their own path. In that area we should be happy to do nothing. We can offer people our good will, but, we should not feel responsible for their mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Doing Nothing with a Purpose</strong></p>
<p>We are doing nothing when we surf through the internet, watch some daytime cooking programme or check our email for a record 16th time in the past two hours. We can be in the vortex of activity but achieve nothing meaningful. The problem is we rush into activity without any preparation or thought. The art of doing nothing involves gaining an inner preparation, a mental stillness and cultivating an inner peace which gives meaning to our outer life. <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/basic-steps-for-learning-meditation/">Meditation</a> is the active cultivation of this inner silence and inner peace. It is the best way to gain a meaningful inner peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-394" title="winding_path" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/winding_path.jpg" alt="winding_path" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>We can also just be more aware of the simplicity of life and nature. We can rush through the most beautiful scenery in the world, but, if we are absorbed in something else, it will be of no benefit. If we pursue simplicity and awareness we will appreciate many simple things alot more.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Be Defensive </strong></p>
<p>It is not nice being criticised either directly or implicitly, but sometimes we worry too much and become very defensive. Learning to pay no heed of misinformed criticism can be a real boon for us.</p>

<p>There was a spiritual Master visiting a village. He spoke to the assembled crowds on living a spiritual life. Many were moved by his words on love and forgiveness. However, at the end of the meeting a young child came up to the Master and tearfully asked him if he would come to visit his house and touch the heart of his father.</p>
<p>The young child told how his father was making life miserable for his wife and children through his uncontrollable drinking. When his father wasn&#8217;t drinking he was a very kind and loving father. But, when he was drunk he made life unbearable for all around.</p>
<p>The Master took the child by the hand and visited the wretched home. He spoke kindly to his mother and her children and then he saw the father lying wretchedly  upon a bed of straw. He took the man by his hand and with great kindness said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Your neighbours on the other side of the town are in sore distress. Their house has been gutted by fire. Will you come and aid me in rebuilding their shattered lives?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The father shrugged off his headache and feeling of worthlessness and nervously followed the Master to the other side of town. There they found a family facing great hardship due to their loss. Without saying any words, the Master and father began re-building the house. After a short while, the drunkard threw himself into the project forgetting his own addictions. After a while the Master thanked the alcoholic for his efforts, but, now he had to leave to travel to another town &#8211; could he leave him in charge? The father readily agreed and over the next weeks organised the complete rebuilding of the house.</p>
<p>In the process, the father gave up drinking completely. Nobody had even mentioned  drink, but, he had gained a renewed sense of purpose and responsibility. He remained grateful for the opportunity to serve others and overcome his addiction.</p>
<p><strong>Commentary</strong></p>
<p>By lecturing people do we ever change their nature? It is easy to judge others, but how can we encourage people to overcome their weaknesses? It would be tempting to scold an alcoholic for neglecting his family. But, here the Master tried a different approach. He sought to rebuild his sense of self-worth and sense of responsibility. Often addictions are symptoms of inner insecurites and we need to deal with these rather than the outer manifestations of them.</p>
<p>By gaining a sense of service to others we can most easily overcome our personal problems.</p>
<p>It also reminds me of the story of <a href="http://www.writespirit.net/authors/sri_ramakrishna">Sri Ramakrishna</a> and his disciple <a href="http://www.writespirit.net/authors/girish_chandra_ghosh">Girish Chandra Ghose</a>. Sri Ramakrishna was a very strict Spiritual Master who expected the highest standards. But, in the case of Girish Chandra Ghose, he never said anything when Girish  turned up with a wine bottle in his hand. Sri Ramakrishna knew in this particular case, he need not say anything, but, overtime by appealing to the good heart of Girish Chandra Ghose, he would eventually make the necessary change in habit himself. This Girish did, becoming a devotee of the highest order.</p>
