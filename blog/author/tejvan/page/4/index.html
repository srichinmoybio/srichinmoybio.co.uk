<blockquote><p>Independent<br />
Nobody is &#8211;<br />
We just fool ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-633-1' id='fnref-633-1'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>Some people find it easy to give, but very difficult to receive; they feel they should remain aloof and independent.</p>
<p>Some find it difficult to give because they worry they will be worse off or gain no benefit.</p>
<p>For example, some people may be willing to offer support to friends, but when they are in difficulty they will feel they shouldn&#8217;t bother other people and refuse any support or help.</p>
<p>It is good to be in a position to give; but if we don&#8217;t allow ourselves to also receive, we can&#8217;t complete the circle. We deny others the opportunity to get joy from giving. We consciously deny ourselves the opportunity to get what we are happy to give others.</p>
<p>Giving is an opportunity to transcend selfish motives and feelings. But receiving is also an opportunity to transcend our pride and ego. Often we refuse to accept support from others out of a sense of personal pride. It may arise from a subtle sense of superiority. When we give, we may feel, perhaps unconsciously, that we are superior to the person who we are giving to. But, if we feel superior about giving, then we will also feel inferior when receiving. That is why we only want to be in the position of giving.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gracious acceptance is an art &#8211; an art which<br />
most never bother to cultivate. We think that we have<br />
to learn how to give, but we forget about accepting<br />
things, which can be much harder than giving&#8230;<br />
Accepting another person&#8217;s gift is allowing<br />
to express his feelings for you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">- Alexander McCall Smith</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, when we learn to both give and receive with equanimity, we will feel neither superior or inferior. We will get joy from both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Before giving, the mind of the giver is happy; while giving, the mind of the giver is made peaceful; and having given, the mind of the giver is uplifted.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">-Buddha</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Keep Count</strong></p>
<p>Another mistake is to think life is like a weighing scale. If we give 10 units to person A, we shouldn&#8217;t wait expecting 10 units in return. It is best to just give and receive in accordance with necessity and follow your heart&#8217;s prompting. If your giving and receiving is calculated like a weighing scale, you will lose all spontaneity and joy from the process.</p>
<p><strong>Receiving and Dependency</strong></p>
<p>There is a big difference between receiving genuine support and becoming dependent on the efforts of others. If we are in a difficult position, we should happily receive from others, but we should not abuse this help and become a drain on the other person&#8217;s good will.</p>
<p>It is the same with giving. Often when we give love, support and aid to others it can help. But, we shouldn&#8217;t be giving without discrimination. We have to keep asking ourselves is this actually helping the other person? If we give support which encourages them to have better self-esteem and self-confidence, then we are facilitating them to solve their own problems. But, if we just give sympathy and try to solve their problems for them, we may not be helping them to learn what they need to know. There is no right answer for how to help others. But, we should be careful of our motives in giving to others.</p>
<p>Beauty of Giving and Receiving.</p>
<p>As John Donne said &#8216;no man is an island&#8217;. When we give and receive unconditionally we remember our extended consciousness our inseperable link with other people. There is a beauty to giving and receiving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beauty is in giving. Beauty is in receiving. Beauty is in giving and giving alone. Beauty is in receiving and receiving alone. When I give, I see that before I have given anything, Heaven is already smiling through my offering, my self-giving. When I receive, I see that earth is smiling in and through me.&#8221;</p>

	<div class="entry">
	    <p>Recently, we were giving a meditation class at a central location in Oxford. On the same evening as our meditation class, another room in the building was host to a lecture series which was part of an event called &#8216;Think Week&#8217;.</p>
<p>The location of our room meant everyone coming for the &#8216;Think&#8217; lecture passed through our room. We would politely ask &#8216;Meditation or Think?&#8217; (I did consider asking &#8216;are you here to think or not to think? but thought it would confuse too much) we would then direct them onto the location. One of the attendees was Richard Dawkins, who had already given a lecture in the series. (Dawkins famous for his book God-Delusion and atheist views). Like others, he briefly he popped into our room before being re-directed on to the more cerebral choice of entertainment for the evening.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what these visitors thought of our simple meditation shrine as they briefly looked in. &#8211; A picture of a spiritual master  a candle, incense, flute music for meditation and flowers&#8230;</p>
<p>It just highlighted the simple choice we face in life. The path of the mind or  the path of the heart.</p>
<p>When we live in the mind, we try desperately to work out which is the best philosophy, the right way of thinking. It is a constant process of judgement, decision and analysis. But, if we meditate and really silence the mind, we don&#8217;t feel this sense of judgement. It is no longer a question of right and wrong, best or worst; it is simply a state of being which is joyful and natural.</p>
<p>In the silence of the heart, there is a natural sense of oneness. This is not a mere intellectual belief/hope we are interconnected. It is a un-mistakeable sense that there is only one of us. And what we do to others, we really do to our-self.</p>
<blockquote><p>Permit not thoughts<br />
To come from near and far.<br />
Let your mind remain<br />
Tranquillity’s blue star.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-643-1' id='fnref-643-1'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>However, if we feel the joy of meditation, the joy of silence, we feel it is not so important as to who is right, but only to remain in this state of being.</p>

<p>There is an oft-repeated saying &#8211; Is the glass half-full or half-empty? It is a key issue in life &#8211; how do we perceive a situation? Give two people the same situation and their perspective / reaction may be very different. All through life we have a choice on what to see and what to choose. This is an attempt to consider how we can see things from a different perspective.</p>
<blockquote><p>If a negative thought<br />
Claims you as its victim,<br />
Can you not immediately take shelter<br />
In the embrace<br />
Of a positive thought?</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-668-1' id='fnref-668-1'>1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Maybe you&#8217;re not right.</strong></p>
<p>It is human nature to think we are right and other people are wrong. This battle to be &#8216;right&#8217; takes up much of our mental time and energy. Sometimes we will try very hard to prove we really are in the right. However, rather than just automatically assume we are right, we could look at the issue from another point of view. Maybe, it is we who are wrong. Even entertaining this idea involves a degree of humility. From their perspective and their world view, they probably consider that they are doing the &#8216;right&#8217; thing. If we can have empathy that they are trying to do the right thing in their own way, it makes us more tolerant, more understanding. Sometimes it&#8217;s not about being &#8216;right&#8217; but approaching the situation in the best way.</p>
<p>A teenager may think the right thing is to explore the world and have the freedom to make choices about life. A parent may feel the &#8216;right&#8217; thing to do is to protect their children from unnecessary dangers. In a way, neither perspective is &#8216;wrong&#8217; But, if we can understand where the other person is coming from it can help a good deal.</p>
<p><strong>Guilt vs Learning Process</strong></p>
<p>We often allow guilt to dominate our mind. We make a mistake and we then carry a heavy burden of guilt around. We feel bad, but we cannot undo what has happened in the past. Another perspective is to see mistakes as inevitable; we learn what we need to and strive not to make the mistake again. This is the positive approach, rather than focusing on what we&#8217;ve done wrong, we focus on what we are going to do right.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t make us callous to our own wrong doing. It is just a way to concentrate on the positive rather than unnecessarily dragging ourselves down. If we hold onto guilt, saying I&#8217;m bad, I&#8217;m bad &#8211; it hardly helps us to do the right thing.</p>
<p>It is a question of perspective, do we feel bad for what we did in the past, or do we feel hopeful for how we will turn our life around?</p>
<p><strong>Victim vs Non-Victim</strong></p>
<p>It is easy to feel the victim &#8211; a victim of circumstances a victim of other peoples words and actions. However, rather than seeing ourselves as a victim, we need to remember we can always choose how we respond to situations. Then we empower ourselves; we can learn to reject negative words and ideas. We can remember our real self and ignore a mistaken identity others would try to impose on us. Then we no longer feel like a victim, instead we see difficult situations as an opportunity to have faith in ourselves.</p>

<p>Misunderstandings seem an inevitable part of human life. Often we see events beyond our control leading to unfortunate misunderstandings. It can be the source of much unhappiness and frustration. But, how do we solve these misunderstandings?</p>
<blockquote><p>Each human being is doomed to stay<br />
In a prison of misunderstanding.<br />
Alas, when will the day dawn<br />
When misunderstanding will be replaced<br />
By heart-understanding<br />
And soul-fulfilling<br />
Summit-oneness?</p></blockquote>
<div id="bookexcerpt">- Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-677-1' id='fnref-677-1'>1</a></sup></div>
<p><strong>1. Talk</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s good to talk. Don&#8217;t have any preconceptions or expectations but just seek to engage and try to simply suggest there may have been an unfortunate misunderstanding. Even, if you feel the other person is in the wrong, don&#8217;t start by blaming them. This is the worst thing as it could get worse. Just say, maybe there was something of a misunderstanding and perhaps you weren&#8217;t away of this. If you do it without judgement, you allow the other person to easily change their views.</p>
<p>Words can be the cause of misunderstanding, so take a moment to reflect before speaking. Don&#8217;t rush into something you later regret.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Don&#8217;t Feel Sorry for Yourself.</strong></p>
<p>If we feel sorry for ourselves, we prevent the misunderstanding being resolved. This is because part of us is holding onto the victim hood of being a misunderstood. Rather than feeling sorry for yourself, seek the best way to create a more harmonious environment.</p>
<p><strong>3. Give.</strong></p>
<p>It is counter-intuitive to give in response to a misunderstanding. But, it can break the ice and show that you are willing to make the best of the situation. If you give unconditionally, it will bring out the best in other people. It will make them think what they can give in return or maybe you&#8217;re not such a bad person after all.</p>
<p>What to give, is something you will need to use your intuition. If you gave some flowers to someone at work, they may just feel embarrassed, to your life partner it may be the perfect thing. You can also give without giving anything materially. You can offer to act as peace-maker, you can give the benefit of the doubt to someone else, you can even just inwardly offer your goodwill; this positive energy will help.</p>
<p><strong>4. Don&#8217;t Worry</strong></p>
<p>The problem with misunderstandings is that we can feel bad if others see us as less than perfect. But, no-one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes or is the victim of misunderstanding. However, the mind can easily magnify the significance of what other people might be thinking. What is important is how we respond and act in this present moment, not what people temporarily thought about us in the past.</p>
<p><strong>5. Keep Perspective</strong></p>
<p>Many misunderstandings are much less significant than our mind manages to make them. When we speak to someone else they may not have even given it a second thought, but we thought it was super-important.</p>
<p><strong>6. Don&#8217;t Dwell on Misunderstanding</strong></p>
<p>A small misunderstanding can be magnified if we give it much of our attention. If we keep thinking about a situation, the power of thought makes it more real. Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to focus on something else and find areas of agreement and understanding. An interesting story. One boss banned emails on Fridays. He found emails where the source of many misunderstanding; on Friday, people had to leave their desks and actually speak to people they had been emailing. This solved many misunderstandings.</p>
<p><strong>7. Don&#8217;t Suspect</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Suspect not, if you want your friendship to last long.<br />
Expect not, if you want your friendship to last not only the longest, but forever.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<div id="bookexcerpt">- Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-677-2' id='fnref-677-2'>2</a></sup></div>
<p>One of the most common causes of misunderstandings is wrongly assigning motives to someone else. If our mind is suspicious then we can easily create misunderstanding. If we have misunderstandings examine your thoughts about whether you have wrongly assigned motives.</p>

<p>Why is it two people can say very similar things, but one comes across as much more appealing than another person? Instinctively we warm to the light touch, we struggle when things get &#8216;heavy&#8217;. This may sound quite vague, but some people and situations give a vibration of &#8216;heaviness&#8217;. A &#8216;heavy&#8217; vibration comes when we are very serious, intense, judgemental, fearful, anxious and tense.</p>
<p>A &#8216;light&#8217; vibrations comes when there is a feeling of friendliness, non-judgemental, calm and maintain a sense of humour and perspective. When we live in the moment, there is a natural spontaneity which gives a feeling of lightness and joy.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Judgemental</strong></p>
<p>When we are very judgemental, it creates a &#8216;heavy&#8217; atmosphere. The other person feels guilty or defensive; there is a feeling of superiority or inferiority. If we avoid judgement, the mood is lighter. When there is a feeling of superiority or inferiority there is tension because people become defensive or seek to justify their position.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do not judge,<br />
But love and be loved,<br />
If you want to be really happy.</p></blockquote>
<div id="bookexcerpt">- Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-673-1' id='fnref-673-1'>1</a></sup></div>
<p><strong>Smile vs Non Smile</strong></p>
<p>As I write this in airport lounge, I see a young child with a T-Shirt saying &#8216;Smiling is Really easy&#8217; &#8211; it certainly made me smile. To grimace as you say something makes the atmosphere &#8216;heavy&#8217;. If you smile, you can convey so much (you could say get away with so much more). It is almost an unspoken signal to say &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m on your side. I like you, whatever I&#8217;m actually saying&#8221; It is worth bearing in mind that an email conveys non of this human emotion and human signals. It is very difficult to make emails light; they can easily be misunderstood. If you need to get a delicate point across do it in person.</p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way to lighten a heavy situation, is just to smile and make people laugh.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Water is fluid, soft, and yielding. But water will wear away rock, which is rigid and cannot yield. As a rule, whatever is fluid, soft, and yielding will overcome whatever is rigid and hard. This is another paradox: what is soft is strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Lao Tsu, Tao Te Ching</p></blockquote>
<p>Similar to the concept of non-judgemental is the ability to accept people and situations as they are. Acceptance enables us to go with the flow, rather than fighting against the tide, we accept the situation as it is.</p>
<p><strong>Humility</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way to lighten up a situation is to not take ourselves too seriously. Don&#8217;t think we alone have all the right answers. Be willing to satirise ourselves and make light of what we say. Rather than being forceful and trying to change people, let them make their own choices and work out best course of action. If we have a feeling of indispensability then we will create a heavy atmosphere, if we are sincerely humble, it will be much more harmonious.</p>
<p><strong>Avoiding Conflict<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, we can face a challenge in a confrontational way. Perhaps someone suggests an idea, which we don&#8217;t like. We could respond by very vigorously saying why they are wrong and why it won&#8217;t work. Needless to say this is a &#8216;heavy&#8217; response. In most situations, this is not necessary. Rather than meet the situation head on we can say. &#8216;Very good, let&#8217;s see what you can make of it.&#8217; &#8211; people often suggest impractical ideas. There&#8217;s no need to tell them, just let them work it out for themselves it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>If it really could create problems, you could suggest things like</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8216;it has some good ideas, but I wonder how Mr X would respond?&#8217;</li>
<li>Perhaps you could consider this.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Silence before you speak.</strong></p>
<p>We have to trust our inner wisdom. If we say the first thing that comes into our mind, we may soon regret it, and once said we can&#8217;t take it back. If we give chance to consider an appropriate response we will feel in our heart what sounds a good way to proceed. If we think, speak and act from this inner source of wisdom then we will be more in tune with a harmonious action.</p>
<p><strong>Giving Rather than taking</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t look at every person and situation to see what you can get from it. Give what you would like to receive yourself. <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/simplicity/the-power-of-giving/">The power of giving</a></p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t complicate things, keep it simple. Don&#8217;t always be trying to justify things or create added complications. Simplicity has a great beauty and power. <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/the-power-of-simplicity/">Tips for simplicity.</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Each thought<br />
Is the creator<br />
Of a new experience.</p></blockquote>
<div id="bookexcerpt">Sri Chinmoy, <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/books/1464"><em>My Christmas-New Year-Vacation Aspiration-Prayers, Part 26,</em></a> Agni Press, 2003.</div>
<p>Imagine if whatever you thought became a reality instantaneously?</p>
<ul>
<li>if you thought of tremendous wealth, you would have it straight away.</li>
<li>If you thought of conflict with another person, the conflict would happen immediately.</li>
<li>If you thought of enjoying a beautiful garden, you could be instantly transported to enjoy its beauty and fragrance.</li>
<li>If you worried about getting a fatal illness, the illness would appear immediately.</li>
<li>If we thought of heaven, we went to heaven.</li>
<li>If we thought of hell, we would go straight to hell.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing is certain, if our thought immediately created, we would be very careful what thoughts we allowed into our mind.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Fulfilling Thoughts.</strong></p>
<p>Thoughts may not instantly create a reality. But, if we persistently dwell on certain train of thoughts, they do lead to some kind of related experience. If we constantly cherish negative thoughts, this will create some negative experience. If we constantly worry, we will draw this experience to us. If we, however,</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts Do Create</strong></p>
<p>Thought is the bridge between heaven and hell. With our thoughts we really can create heaven or hell. When we are angry, fearful, resentful, is this not our own personal hell? If we hold only beautiful, inspiring and kind thoughts our life is enjoyable. Thoughts do create our experience.</p>
<p>If we have thoughts that &#8216;we don&#8217;t have enough&#8217;. Then immediately, we are creating that feeling of not having enough. If we have a thought of inadequacy, that is our present reality. If a millionaire is constantly thinking he needs money, that is his reality &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t have enough money. If an ordinary person is content with what he has, then that is immediately his reality. Here it is not how much money we have, but what we are thinking of. We can be materially rich, but think we need more. We can be materially poor, but feel we just have enough.</p>

<p><strong>Behind Thought.</strong></p>
<p>Thought is very powerful, more powerful than we realise. But, there is more to our self than thoughts that come across our mind. If we can silence our thought, we can get in touch with our deeper self, our soul. If we can move away from the mind to the heart, then we can allow the power of silence to create a more peaceful experience.</p>

<p>There are many different ways to respond to the same situation. Often it is easy to consider ourselves as a victim &#8211; a victim of circumstances, a victim of other people, a victim of events. The alternative is to see not ourselves as a victim, but look upon life as a series of experiences. These are a few practical examples of how to look at the world in another light.</p>
<p><strong>Criticism</strong></p>
<p>Often we feel a victim when criticised. Why was person X unpleasant to us?  Why have I been mercilessly criticised for no fault of my own?</p>
<p>There will always be people who say unkind things, but we don&#8217;t have to take it to heart. Rather than feel a victim, we can feel that they are just mistaken; and their words can not hurt our real self at all. If we can respond with forgiveness and detachment, we will be happy that we can rise above unkind words.</p>
<p>This might seem easier in theory than practise, but on a practical level, we should be very clear in our mind that this criticism is not warranted. Imagine the words and then cross them out; you could even try writing the negative thoughts down and then cross them out!</p>
<p>If we feel unfairly criticised, take the time to encourage some positive ideas about yourself. If people say you are incompetent, remember all the good things you have done.</p>
<p>It is then a choice, do we take their ill-chosen words and incorrect views to heart? or do we take it as an opportunity to remember who we really are? If we can hold onto a positive (and true) view about ourselves we won&#8217;t feel a victim. If anything the person who spreads gossip is the loser; negativity eventually will return to its source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why is it Always Me?</strong></p>
<p>Another idea we may frequently feel, is why does it always happen to me? Why do I always have to do the difficult / unpleasant things.</p>
<p>For example, if we feel that it is always us who is cleaning up, there are two things to ask yourself.</p>
<p><strong>1) Am I actually choosing to be the one who always cleans-up</strong>? Sometimes, we don&#8217;t like doing something, but when someone comes along to offer help, we reject it. Or perhaps someone would be happy to help if we ask, but we never get round to it. We may lack confidence to ask, or we may actually (unconsciously) like to play the role of martyr. There is part of us, who actually likes complaining to ourselves that WE have to be the one to do the hard work. You can think of this as an underlying thought. We don&#8217;t like always being the one to do the dirty work, but subconsciously we are actually choosing it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;But who sincerely wants the elimination of suffering? We are all acting like camels. The camel eats cactus thorns until its mouth bleeds; then it goes and again eats thorns. In some way, consciously or unconsciously, the camel cherishes thorns. We human beings also cherish suffering, unconsciously or consciously. As long as we cherish suffering, there will always remain suffering on earth.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-671-1' id='fnref-671-1'>1</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>On a practical level, visualise someone coming to help. Visualise asking your friends who are then glad to help. Make it clear to others what you are happy to do, but you would like others to also participate. Don&#8217;t feel guilty in asking, and don&#8217;t make people feel guilty for not guessing you needed help. Put it in a positive light.<br />
&#8220;I would be very grateful, if you could help a little…&#8221;</p>
<p>When you put it like that, you appeal to people&#8217;s good nature and they may well do more than you ask. Sometimes  all you really need to do is to ask!</p>
<p><strong>2) Why not just enjoy doing the cleaning?</strong> If the above fails, there is another option. If we have to be the one who cleans up, why not just be happy for the opportunity to clean up? Sometimes we can clean and be really happy; it&#8217;s a nice simple job with satisfaction of creating a more beautiful environment. Alternatively, we can clean but spend all the time grumble that we have to do it. We really may have no choice to clean. But, we do have a choice whether to do it willingly and cheerfully or with ill-feeling.</p>
<p>The problem is you may be really determined not want to enjoy the cleaning. Part of you thinks it&#8217;s not unfair that I have to do that, and so because it&#8217;s unfair I&#8217;m going to be unhappy and let everyone else know too.</p>
<p>But, another way of looking at it is &#8211; it may be unfair, but that&#8217;s not a reason to make myself unhappy. If I can be happy doing this, it will make me stronger.</p>
<p>What ever we find ourselves doing it, try to be happy from the experience. Don&#8217;t make yourself feel miserable because there is a feeling of injustice.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Luck</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has bad luck and bad breaks. Some don&#8217;t give up at the first time. Just think of a famous person like Abraham Lincoln &#8211; not the most attractive person, he suffered a raft of bad luck, however, he never let his bad luck stop him. He just kept trying until he succeeded.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This exercise is quite easy and makes an excellent introduction to meditation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit comfortable and tell yourself for next ten minutes you will just focus on this exercise and nothing else.</li>
<li>Begin by observing thoughts that come into your mind. Make no effort to control or direct thoughts, just see which thoughts come into your mind.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t judge yourself or your thoughts, but just feel you are watching these thoughts pass through your mind.</li>
<li>The secret is to feel that &#8216;you&#8217; are able to see the thoughts coming from outside into your self. This makes you feel that your thoughts are actually external to your real self. You realise the real &#8216;you&#8217; is not your thoughts, but something which can view, follow and reject thoughts</li>
<li>The next stage is to let go of any thought that comes into your mind. As soon as a thought comes stop following it. Don&#8217;t pursue it any further. If you feel it is helpful, imagine you are throwing the thought out of your mind (you can feel you are just waving it away)</li>
<li>Again don&#8217;t judge any thought that comes in, don&#8217;t get annoyed if your mind creates many thoughts, just persist in waving them away.</li>
<li>Now, try to lengthen the moments of silence in between thoughts. Try to stop them coming in at all.</li>
<li>Even if thoughts do appear, feel they are very separate to you, like fish in the sea they have no effect, but feel very distant and separate. They may be there but they can&#8217;t affect you.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise is a good step to becoming aware there is more to your reality than your thoughts. Even if thoughts appear in your mind, they have less power, less hold over you. When the power of thought is diminished, it is easier to go deep into the silent mind &#8211; which is the secret of meditation.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Meditation is the art of discovering what we already have. At the moment, we are not aware of our soul&#8217;s peace because our mind is clouded by our own thoughts. Meditation is learning how to still the mind and enter into this deeper part of ourself.</p>
<p>These steps are the essential aspects of learning how to meditate</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity and Experience</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, meditation is not a complicated or intellectual subject; meditation is inherently simple. When we meditate well, we feel we are doing something natural, spontaneous and joyful. We can read many books about meditation, but to really know what it is &#8211;  we have to practise and experience meditation for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Concentration</strong></p>
<p>The first step in meditation is to improve our concentration. This is the ability to be aware and focused on only one thing at a time. When we concentrate we put all our attention into the smallest object and exclude everything else. Often in daily life, we get easily distracted; the mind flits from one subject to another. But, when starting meditation we try to keep our attention closely focused. As soon as our mind wanders, we need to bring it back on the object of our concentration. Feel like you are a charioteer, whenever the horse (your mind) veers off course, you must use the reins to keep it going in the right direction.</p>
<p>To improve concentration, <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/an-easy-to-learn-concentration-exercise/">try this simple concentration exercise</a>, which involves focusing on a candle.</p>
<p><strong>Breathing</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is more natural and spontaneous than breathing. It is the essence of life, yet  mostly we breathe unconsciously. We can use our breathing to help our meditation.</p>
<ul>
<li> A very simple exercise is to watch your own breath.</li>
<li>Feel the breathe coming into your body.</li>
<li>Take a pause to hold your breath momentarily before exhaling.</li>
<li>The secret is to concentrate all your attention on your breathing.</li>
<li>Ignore everything else, but the simple awareness of breathing.</li>
<li>When breathing in, you can also imagine you are breathing in the quality of peace.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple breathing exercise gives us something very simple to focus on. It also helps to quieten the mind as breathing has a strong influence on our state of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline The Mind</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;When you meditate, what you actually do is  to enter into a calm or  still, silent mind. We have to be fully aware  of the arrival and attack  of thoughts. That is to say, we shall not  allow any thought, divine or  undivine, good or bad, to enter into our  mind. Our mind should be  absolutely silent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-652-1' id='fnref-652-1'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>To get the most from meditation, we need to still the mind. We need to detach from our own thoughts so that the mind eventually becomes silent. When the mind is vacant and still it gives room for peace to enter. There is an old saying that to fill a pot with milk, you must first empty all the water first. It is the same with meditation, we try to empty our mind of useless thoughts, so we can make room for the peace and bliss of meditation.</p>
<p><strong>How to Quieten the Mind.</strong></p>
<p>When you first start meditation, you may be surprised at how active your mind is. But, don&#8217;t despair, it can definitely be made quiet.</p>
<ul>
<li>As soon as a thought comes, don&#8217;t pursue it. Let go. Feel it is as insignificant as a fly.</li>
<li>Feel thoughts are separate to your self. Feel thoughts are coming from outside of you. Then, even if they come, they will feel less pressing, more distant and easier to ignore.</li>
<li>See also: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/how-to-stop-negative-thoughts/">How to stop negative thoughts</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Heart</strong></p>
<p>It is hard to meditate in the mind. Instead we can use the power of the heart. The heart isn&#8217;t just a physical organ, it is in the heart that we can feel the presence of our soul &#8211; our innermost self. The nature of the heart is to experience oneness and peace. The heart doesn&#8217;t manufacture thoughts. When our mind feels it is revolving like a wheel, we can try diving into the heart. Try to feel your sense of being is leaving the brain, leaving the mind and entering into the heart. If you can focus your sense of self here, it will be much easier to be unencumbered by thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Aspiration</strong></p>
<p>My meditation teacher, Sri Chinmoy, says the real secret of meditation is not in mastering different techniques; the real secret is our own inner aspiration &#8211; our inner cry to grow into something deeper, vaster and more fulfilling. If we are not happy with our state of mind, if we really want to experience peace in our life &#8211; then we are ready for meditation. When we have this psychic urge our own soul will be able to come to the fore and offer us the experience of meditation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;How do you meditate? You meditate with  an inner cry. There should be  an inner cry here, in the heart. The  outer cry is ego-centred; it wants  name and fame. &#8230; While you are feeling this inner cry, you try  to  make the mind absolutely calm and quiet. If a thought enters your  mind,  you try to reject it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-652-2' id='fnref-652-2'>2</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we feel our aspiration is weak and feeble, that doesn&#8217;t matter. We may start meditation  merely with curiosity. However, we can strengthen our aspiration by reading books by Spiritual Teachers and associating with other spiritual seekers.</p>
<p><strong>Mantra</strong></p>
<p>The use of mantra can definitely help meditation. On some paths of meditation, the repetition of mantra may be the main aspect of that meditation. On our path of meditation, I use mantra when my mind feels unruly. By repeating a sacred word, we can bring purity into our mind. This enables the mind to be quieter and more receptive to meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Regularity</strong></p>
<p>There are no short cuts to mastering meditation. We should see meditation like developing a muscle or learning to play an instrument. If we do it sporadically, we will struggle to make any progress. However, if we devotedly do it everyday, we give ourselves the opportunity to make progress and get stronger. To discipline the mind is not something we can do overnight. And we should never get frustrated by our seeming lack of progress. We have been thinking all our life, we are now trying to do something radically different. We need to be patient with ourselves, but also have the firm faith in ourselves that we can master our own self. If we cannot master our own mind, no one will be able to do it for us! But never feel we are a slave to our mind. We never have to surrender  to our own thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Inspirational Place</strong></p>
<p>When we are very advanced in our meditation, we will be able to meditate anywhere, be it on a plane or bus. But, in the beginning small details can make a big difference and give us an extra boost to learning how to meditate. If we create a small corner of the room and make a simple meditation shrine, it will inspire us to meditate. We can use a candle, flower, and anything that will inspire us in meditation.</p>
<p>There are many more aspects to learning to meditate. The main thing is just to start! Just try it today and make a plan to meditate everday. It will also be much easier to meditate if you can associate with other people who also meditate. They may not be in a position to teach, but it is good to gain inspiration from others who are doing a similar practise.</p>
