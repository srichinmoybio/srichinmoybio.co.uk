<blockquote><p>Instead of thinking<br />
Of everyone,<br />
Just love everyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy (1)</p>
<p>I was reading some aphorisms in a book when I came across this short poem, and it hit me like a proverbial metaphysical sledgehammer (whatever that might be) over the head. It made me realise how I waste too much time thinking of others.</p>
<p>We all have a tendency to think of others a lot. We sometimes remember their good qualities and how they helped us. But, unfortunately, we tend to think about how others have aggrieved us or let us down or how they are far from perfect. When we think of others, we can&#8217;t help judging them. When we are judging people we are not loving them. Love is not love when we spend all the time ruminating over their imperfections. As the immortal bard said with poetic brilliance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br />
Admit impediments. Love is not love<br />
Which alters when it alteration finds,<br />
Or bends with the remover to remove:</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; William Shakespeare Sonnet 116</p>
<p><strong>Avoiding Speculation</strong></p>
<p>One of the most dangerous characteristics of our mind / thought process is to engage in speculation over potential outcomes. Our mind can come up with fantastic speculations, often fearing the worst outcome / worst motive of others. When we let the mind run riot, our thinking can gradually become divorced from reality; we can start assigning motives and false ideas about friends and families. This can be the cause for deep misunderstanding. (See: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/avoiding-misunderstanding/">How to avoid misunderstanding</a>) This is a good reason to spend less time thinking / speculating.</p>
<p><strong>How To Love Others</strong></p>
<p>What does it mean to love others? Perhaps it is hard to say, if the poets struggle, how can we write about love adequately? But, I think we can more easily say what real love is not. If our love is conditional, if we expect certain things to be reciprocated, this is just emotional attachment (See: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/how-to-distinguish-between-love-and-emotional-dependence/">difference between love and emotional dependence</a>). Love is not judging the person with our critical mind. It is not about getting angry with someone because they are falling below our expected standards. We could say love is an instinctive emotion / quality; it is only that love often gets clouded with the darkness of our mind and thoughts. If we can avoid clouding our opinions with negativity, then naturally we will be offering our good will to others.</p>
<p>It is said that we hate whom we really wish to love. Hate is just blocking the natural flowing nature of love. If we remove barriers such as hate, then we can love others spontaneously and unconditionally.</p>
<h4>Practical Steps To Take<strong><br />
</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Brood</strong>. When we brood, we inevitably spend our time thinking, (rarely positive) thoughts. Rather than brood, it is much more worthwhile to move forward, to do something positive. If we spend time with other people in a positive activity, we haven&#8217;t got time to brood over our inner thoughts &#8211; nursing minor grievances and feelings of being hard done to.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Think anything you wouldn&#8217;t say aloud</strong>. This is a bit of a challenge. Analyse your thoughts that come through your mind; would you be embarrassed to speak them out aloud in front of other people? We shouldn&#8217;t feel thoughts are not important because only we can hear them. They are important &#8211; they determine our mood, they affect the energy we offer to other people. We can choose whether to send good will or send our judgemental thoughts. There is a big difference between the two.</p>
<p>To some extent our thoughts will create outer circumstances. If we are constantly thinking negative thoughts about other people, it will inevitable create outer difficulties in our relationship with other people.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking of Others Before Ourselves</strong></p>
<p>One thing we often are told to do is to think of others before ourselves. What this implies is that we consider their needs / welfare; how can we help / serve others. This encourages us to be self-giving and selfless. It encourages us to offer good will to others. It doesn&#8217;t mean we just sit thinking of them. This is a practical implementation of love. When we put others before ourself, we are expanding our sense of self and becoming less selfish.</p>

<p>It is often said that human nature is as stubborn as a mule. It is said, you can&#8217;t change the spots on a Dalmatian, nor can you change the stubbornness of the human mind. But, change is not only possible, it is inevitable at some stage in our evolution. To change ourselves is certainly the greatest challenge that we can take up, it is also the most rewarding activity that we can do.</p>
<p>How To Change?</p>
<p><strong>We Need to Want To Change.</strong></p>
<p>We have to feel the necessity of changing our nature. If we don&#8217;t want to change, how can we expect the universe to do it for us when we are sleeping in the land of nod? If we understand the benefits of changing, half the battle is won. This is essentially a choice to be happy rather than unhappy. If we cling to jealousy, despair and self-pity we will only bring unhappiness onto ourselves. If we wish to be genuinely happy, we have to understand the necessity of overcoming our weakness and undivine qualities.</p>
<p><strong>The Inner Cry</strong></p>
<p>We can&#8217;t change human nature with a proud and haughty attitude. When we inwardly cry for our nature&#8217;s transformation it becomes possible. To inwardly cry for a better life, is to sincerely reject our wrong thoughts, and wrong state of mind. The inner cry is never an ostentatiously display of emotion. It is a private aspiration, it is our real humility coming to the fore. When we inwardly cry for change, we let go of our pride and self-sufficiency. It is in this state that we will feel sweetness and softness; we will see the futility of our self-imposed lofty pride and unhappiness.</p>
<p><strong>Persistence and Determination</strong></p>
<p>Many  people know what to do,<br />
But few care how to do,<br />
And fewer still dare to do.</p>
<div id="bookexcerpt">- Sri Chinmoy (1)</div>
<p>We cannot change human nature overnight. We need persistence. We need to constantly reject the onset of negative thoughts as often as they come to us. We need to remember constantly what we want to change into. As soon as we start taking the wrong approach we need to check ourselves and put us back on track.</p>
<p><strong>Play Tricks</strong></p>
<p>If all fails, we can play tricks on ourselves. Even if we are insincere we can smile at others. We can try to offer something to other people. We may feel that we are being insincere, and we don&#8217;t really mean it. But, it is much better to offer an insincere smile than a sincere growl. We may start off with insincerity, but, we may end up believing our own tricks. Our insincere smile will turn into a sincere and genuine happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Brood.</strong></p>
<p>The worst stumbling block to change is to brood on our shortcomings, limitations and misdeeds. Our mind has remarkable capacity to heighten and magnify our problems. Before we know it, a small problem has magnified into the pinnacle of despair. However, this is only strengthening our ego; it is only strengthening our weaknesses and problems. It is always better to be active, to talk, to do something positive. When we are in a negative frame of mind it is not the time to be silent and lethargic.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Let Your Pride Hold You Back.</strong></p>
<p>Often part of us wants to change, but, there is a part of us which consciously or subconsciously wants to hold on to the undivine part of us. There is a subtle pride in maintaining our grimness, our misery. We feel that to be happy is to humble our ego. The problem is we come to identify ourselves with this part of us which is holding us back. If we see our own folly it becomes easier to let go of it. Again the key is we need to want to change.</p>
<p><strong>Be Selfless.</strong></p>
<p>It may be difficult to change for ourselves, but, it is easier to change when we think of others. If we love people we will want to offer something positive and not something negative which holds them back and makes them suffer too.</p>

<p>Recently, I offered a few <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/meditation-exercises/">meditation exercises</a>. For those interested in meditation, these are a few practical tips that I have felt worked for me during the past 11 years of meditating every day.</p>
<p><strong>Great Power in Group Meditation.</strong></p>
<p>Meditation is about consciousness. If other people are aspiring to the same meditative consciousness it becomes easier for you to be receptive to it. If you are  in New York Times Square, meditation will feel practically impossible. Of course, when we are very advanced, we will have the ability to meditate anywhere, but, in the beginning we should take any help we can get. In the beginning we will make more progress by meditating in sacred spaces and with others who are experienced in meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Feel Thoughts as Separate from Yourself.</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning it is very difficult to stop thoughts coming. But, you can feel thoughts as separate from yourself. Feel that each thought is coming from outside, and you can be like a gatekeeper allowing or stopping them. For a while, thoughts will keep coming into your mind. But, when you start to feel thoughts are separate to your real existence, they lose half their power. It is this feeling of separation from your thoughts that enables you to finally silence the mind.</p>
<p><strong>It is not Like Turning on a Light Switch.</strong></p>
<p>Meditation is a gradual process. You can&#8217;t expect instant  enlightenment. It requires constant vigilance and practise. But,  sometimes when you least expect it, you will be able to go much deeper  than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>Soulful Music </strong></p>
<p>Meditation is a sacred activity. It is an awareness of a divine consciousness. Anything that turns the mind to loftier thoughts and experiences will help us in our meditation. We need to feel an aspiration to grow into something more fulfilling and illumining. Soulful music or writings by Spiritual Masters and great seekers can give us that inspiration to delve deep within.</p>
<p><strong>Try a Different Place</strong></p>
<p>We are used to living and identifying with the mind. The nature of the mind is to think, judge and separate. These qualities of the mind are the opposite to true meditation, so if you have difficulty quietening the mind, try focusing on the heart. You have to put your whole attention and concentration on this place in the centre of your chest. Try to feel that your whole existence has become your heart.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Judge Your Meditation</strong></p>
<p>It is easy to become frustrated that our meditation is not progressing as we would like. Don&#8217;t hold onto expectations of certain experiences, concentrate on being in the present moment without judgement. If we are drawn to meditation every day, this alone is a good sign. Don&#8217;t give up just because one morning it was difficult; just try again at a more conducive time.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you meditate, please do not expect anything either from yourself or from God. You will be able to make the fastest progress if you do not expect anything from your meditation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>To make spiritual progress, certain qualities are indispensable. It is not enough to buy a few books and find the right spiritual path. You can surround yourself with the best wisdom and enlightened souls, but if we cling to our pride, stubbornness or a distorted view of reality, our progress can be worse than useless.</p>
<p>These are some Qualities essential for Self Improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Honesty With Yourself.</strong></p>
<p>There is a saying &#8216;The Truth Hurts&#8217;. In one sense the truth will hurt our ego or pride. But, to make progress it is essential we can be honest with ourselves. This means we are perfectly clear on our own inner motives. We may be able to fool other people we are acting selflessly, we may even be able to fool ourselves, but, if we can fool ourselves how can we make progress?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Try to make yourself honest. If you become honest, then rest assured  there will be one rascal less in the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Thomas Carlyle</p>
<p>For example, maybe we are unhappy with someone close to us. If we are honest, we will recognise that part of us is jealous of their success and / or feel insecure that we are no longer so valuable. However, the nature of our mind is that we tend to ignore our own emotions of jealousy and concentrate on justifying why they are bad and holding us back. We might not like to admit we are jealous because we know we shouldn&#8217;t harbour such feelings. But, until we admit we are feeling jealous we will be unable to overcome it.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Practise Endless Self-Justification</strong></p>
<p>Self Justification is an almost endless habit of human nature. It stems from the desire to protect our status, social recognition and ego. When things are going wrong, we try to blame other people, external situations, anything but take responsibility for our own mistakes or wrong attitude.</p>
<p>If there is a real misunderstanding, then clearing it up can be helpful. The problem comes when we expend so much energy on justifying our wrong actions we almost come to believe we haven&#8217;t done anything wrong and so we effectively perpetuate our wrong attitudes and thoughts.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am at once a fool and a rogue<br />
When I blame others<br />
For my own misdeeds.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy (1)</p>
<p>This is closely related to being honest with ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Willingness to Change.</strong></p>
<p>The nature of the mind is that it always likes to think it is right. Whatever idea / thoughts come into the mind, we always think we are right and everyone else is wrong. This can also breed a sense of self-righteousness and moral superiority.</p>
<p>We have to be very careful with out mental judgements. When we judge a situation or other people, we have to be aware we are only seeing part of the situation / part of the problem. The mind latches onto a few mistakes, but we need to remember the good qualities of the person. If we use our heart more we would be much less judgemental.</p>
<p>We also have to bear in mind, we may be wrong, or at least partly wrong. And where we are wrong, we have to be willing to change. To cling to misplaced ideas just because we don&#8217;t like to admit we are wrong, may have a place in the political world, but, in the spiritual world, it is just self-defeating.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: georgia,bookman old style,palatino linotype,book antiqua,palatino,trebuchet ms,helvetica,garamond,sans-serif,arial,verdana,avante garde,century gothic,comic sans ms,times,times new roman,serif;">&#8220;The man who never alters his opinion is like standing  water, and breeds reptiles of the mind.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Be Careful of the Ego.</strong></p>
<p>One of the main aspects of self-improvement is diminishing the importance of our egoism. At the start we cannot eliminate our ego completely. But, we can be aware of the ego&#8217;s demands for name and fame. We try to be less influenced by the ego and be more humble. But, the ego is tricky,  instead of being proud of worldly accomplishments, the ego can subtly become proud of its spiritual achievements &#8211; &#8216;O how spiritual I am! We may not say it outwardly, but, part of us is feeling that. In a way a the spiritual ego is much worse than an ordinary ego. When we become proud of our spirituality / religion, we become self-righteousness with a subtle feeling of moral superiority. We have to be very careful of the ego&#8217;s emotions and intentions and make sure it doesn&#8217;t sneak in an unexpected guise.</p>
<p><strong>Patience and Persistence.</strong></p>
<p>For thousands of years, man has been trying to perfect his human nature. Some spiritual paths suggest the cycle of perfection can take hundreds or thousands of human incarnations. Whether we believe in reincarnation or not, we have to admit that transforming human nature is a long and gradual path. Of course, it is not all difficulty and problems; it can be very rewarding to make progress, but at the same time we have to have patience and a steady perseverance. There is nothing to be gained by an impatient desire to expect instant perfection.</p>
<p><strong>Cheerfulness.</strong></p>
<p>When we are happy we can make progress. If we cling to unhappiness and dissatisfaction, progress will remain a far cry.  Cheerfulness requires a good balance in life. It involves having a childlike attitude. Sometimes, part of us feels attracted to suffering; we subtly hold onto a feeling of being wronged, suffering. This can be very pervasive and difficult to get rid of. But, we need to be cheerful.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For joy and not for sorrow earth was made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>There are a variety of different meditation exercises we can try. But, the important thing is not the number or type of meditation exercises that we learn &#8211; but how we practise them. The essential qualities of meditation we need to develop are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intensity. If meditate half-heartedly, we will struggle to meditate.</li>
<li>One Pointed Concentration. However, we meditate, we have to feel at the time nothing else is important. Nothing else should come to bother us.</li>
<li>Aspiration. This is the desire to dive deep within and experience a more divine consciousness. If we feel this need for real peace and joy, we will have the intensity and discipline to meditate.</li>
<li>Regularity. Meditation is an art. We need a daily discipline to improve our ability to detach from the mind.</li>
<li>Ability to detach from thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you meditate, what you actually do is  to enter into a calm or still, silent mind. We have to be fully aware  of the arrival and attack of thoughts. That is to say, we shall not  allow any thought, divine or undivine, good or bad,  to enter into our  mind. Our mind should be  absolutely silent. Then we have to go deep  within; there we have to observe our real existence. &#8220;</p></blockquote>

</ul>
<p>When giving meditation classes in Oxford, I tell people about different  meditation exercises, Sri Chinmoy has written about. Other paths, will  have their own variations and types of meditation exercises. However, I personally find these three meditation exercises very effective. Often people report that they have good results from these.</p>
<h3>Three Simple Meditation Exercises</h3>
<p><strong>1. Concentration on A Candle</strong></p>
<p>Basically, we put all our attention and focus onto a small tip of the candle. We exclude everything else from our awareness. With this concentration we can make great progress with meditation. See &#8211; <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/an-easy-to-learn-concentration-exercise/">Simple To Learn Concentration Exercise</a></p>
<p><strong>2. One-Four-Two Breathing.</strong></p>
<p>Many forms of meditation use observance of your breathe. This is a simple, but, powerful exercise which can absorb your attention and enable you to go deep within. In addition, our breathing can have a profound impact on our state of mind. I often use this exercise myself, because I find it very helpful.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The rhythm of your breathing is most important. If you breathe in for one second or for one repetition of the name of the  Supreme, then you should hold the breath for four seconds or four repetitions. Then, when you  breathe out, it should be for two  seconds or the time it takes you to repeat the name of the Supreme  twice. The breathing should be done  softly and silently. When you breathe in and out, you should do it so  gently that, even if there were a thread right in front of your nose,  your breathing would not move it.&#8221;  (- Sri Chinmoy, Pranayama. <a href="http://www.yogaofsrichinmoy.com/yoga/pranayamafolder/pranayama">Read More</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3. Meditation on the Heart</strong></p>
<p>It is in the heart where we find it easiest to distance ourselves from our own mind and own thoughts. The nature of the mind is to think, judge and separate. The nature of the heart is to feel oneness, love and identification with a vaster consciousness.</p>
<p>We can just concentrate on our own heart beat and try to imagine our whole sense of being is located in the heart. If you find helpful you could visualise a beautiful garden or light within your heart centre. Try this <a href="http://www.srichinmoy.tv/tv/128">Meditation on the Heart Lotus</a> Video</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(<em>An active volcano &#8211; New Zealand &#8211; from www.worldharmonyrun.org</em>)</p>
<p>In April, I travel to Jamaica, Queens, New York for a meditation retreat with my friends in the Sri Chinmoy Centre. It is a great opportunity to forget work, and the usual business concerns and spend time meditating and other spiritual activities. As I was preparing to return home, I heard news of flights cancelled and an erupting Volcano. My first thoughts were &#8211; that will soon pass, I mean who has ever heard of airplane flights been cancelled because of erupting volcanoes? But, as it got closer to my departure day, it dawned on me that Mother Nature is never bound by our fixed routines and expectations.</p>
<p>Suddenly all your plans, routines and expectations are tossed aside and you are left with a very different experience. I was fortunate, in that I had a nice place I could continue to stay and many friends around me were in the same boat, so to speak. But, the nature of our mind is to dislike any disruptions to our plans and routines; and the worst is not knowing what if anything will happen.</p>
<h4>What can we do when our world is turned upside down?</h4>
<p><strong>Keep Things In Perspective</strong></p>
<p>Not being able to get to work on time, is not the end of the world. Temporary material discomforts will make us appreciate a return to normality. If we can keep things in perspective it will avoid unnecessary despair. Even the worst experiences are not for ever. It is even more important to avoid speculating on an apocalyptic turn of events. Sometimes things look bleak in the present time, but, turn out to be less bad than feared.</p>
<p>Of course, when you&#8217;ve spent three hours trying to get through to Virgin Atlantic on a cold pay phone, on some New York side street, it&#8217;s much easier to talk of detachment and keeping things in perspective than actually practise it. But, nevertheless, we do need to try and be detached.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort and Progress</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes discomfort can bring unexpected qualities forward. It can give people opportunity for self-giving and concern for others. Severe challenges give us an opportunity to make progress by forcing us out of a comfort zone. When life is easy and predictable we can become passive and more easily bored. I&#8217;m not saying I would ever choose to be stranded in the middle of nowhere, with no means of getting home. But, when difficult experiences come, they can be turned to a useful and beneficial experience so long as we don&#8217;t panic and concentrate on the negatives.</p>
<blockquote><p>An unavoidable necessity<br />
Can quite often be<br />
An unexpected opportunity.</p></blockquote>
<div id="bookexcerpt">by Sri Chinmoy (1)</div>
<p><strong>Remain Cheerful.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t feel guilty or frustrated about something you have no control over. It&#8217;s tempting to start blaming airline staff for somehow being unable to control the eruption of a volcano. An event like a volcanic eruption merely shows that there will always be things in life over which we have absolutely no control. We can&#8217;t stop a volcano, we can only stop our depressed thoughts.</p>
<p>If we can&#8217;t return home because of some event beyond your control, it is absurd to start feeling guilty, even if we have an unsympathetic boss.</p>
<p>If we can remain cheerful and positive in a crisis, it will be a source of strength to others. Often thinking of others, is the best way to stay positive and cheerful ourselves. It prevents us becoming too introspective.<br />

<p>I love simplicity. The idea of minimalism is also fascinating. The complexity of modern life only heightens the contrast between a path of simplicity and a path of complexity and clutter.</p>
<p>I am often drawn to a minimalist approach &#8211; this usually involves having a large scale clear out of all my clutter. I get great joy from giving unused things away. (though invariably, I will later find that the unused bike light of 2 years is suddenly needed.)</p>
<p>But, if life is stressful and cluttered it is very worthwhile evaluating what we can do without.</p>
<p><strong>The More We Possess the More We Have To Worry About.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: georgia,bookman old style,palatino linotype,book antiqua,palatino,trebuchet ms,helvetica,garamond,sans-serif,arial,verdana,avante garde,century gothic,comic sans ms,times,times new roman,serif;"> How many things are there which I do not want. </span></p></blockquote>

<p>The more we posses the more we worry about losing what we have. The more things that grab our attention, the more stressed we can be. Letting go of unnecessary possessions gives a feeling of relief. Rather than seeing how many possessions we can accumulate, we can take the alternative approach which is to make do with what we actually need.</p>
<p><strong>Finding Space For the Important</strong></p>
<p>We often have a subconscious fear of being with ourselves. We fill our life with external distractions. Superficial internet communications, hours in front of the tv. We want something to distract us, and we start to feel uncomfortable when it is not there. A life of simplicity enables us to be free of so many distractions and exterior pulls. It frees us to be able to know ourselves; it gives us freedom to concentrate on the important things in life. It gives us freedom to know the inner joyful nature of our being.</p>
<blockquote><p>Simplicity is our natural or conscious awareness of reality. The moment  we realise our highest transcendental Reality, we become simple. In the  spiritual life, the higher we go, the deeper we go; the farther we go,  the more we will see that Reality is only the song of simplicity and  nothing else. The entire cosmic Game is extremely simple, but we look at  it from a different angle in an obscure way.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy (1)</p>
<p><strong>Attachment and Non-Attachment.</strong></p>
<p>There is a story about King Janaka from ancient India. He was a great King with tremendous wealth, but, he was also a great spiritual aspirant. He ruled wisely without attachment to his material wealth. On one occasion, King Janaka was visiting a holy man in the mountains. Then the King and all his people heard about a great disaster which was striking the city. Immediately, all the people rushed to protect their belongings. But, King Janaka alone stayed at the feet of his Guru in the Mountains. He had the most to lose, but, he also had the greatest detachment from his material possessions. This is a reminder that it is not the number of possessions that is important, but, our attitude. Having a small number of possessions is no guarantee we will be detached from unfulfilled material desire. We can be rich and at the same time focused on the inner life and what is important.</p>
<p><strong>Pride and Minimalism</strong></p>
<p>I sometimes take great pride in clearing out clutter. But, then regret it, as I realise later I will need to re buy what is now sitting in a charity shop. If we become dogmatic about our minimalism it can be as much a burden as a blessing. If we accumulate stuff for the sake of it, that is not helpful. But, if we are dynamically active in offering something to the world, we may find a garage overflowing with humanitarian aid. Minimalism is good if it helps us to reduce unnecessary desires, distractions and clutter, but, it cannot alone be the goal of life. The real simplicity needs to be in the mind and heart, not in external surroundings.</p>

<p><em>How To Become A Better Person (in under 300 words)</em></p>
<p><strong>Think of other people</strong>.  Consider how you can make others happy and encourage them to do the right thing. Spend time to appreciate their good qualities  and boost their self-esteem.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t act for selfish motives</strong>. Don’t seek to gain at the expense of others.  Don’t speak ill of friends for the motive of impressing other people.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t waste time in seeking praise</strong>. Learn to let go of your ego. Humility does not mean putting yourself down. It means being content with what you are, without external praise / blame.</p>
<p><strong>Never be jealous of others’ success or happiness</strong>. Learn to be happy through the well being of others. If others do good things, feel it is partly your achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be attached to a negative frame of mind</strong>. As frequently as necessary, let go of negative thoughts. Don’t brood and be despondent. Be wary often the ego is involved in moods of despair and unhappiness. Cultivate cheerfulness.</p>
<p><strong>Smile</strong>. If nothing else try to smile when meeting others.</p>
<p><strong>Be enthusiastic in what you do</strong>.  Whatever you find yourself doing, try to be enthusiastic and positive. Even the smallest act done with love and enthusiasm can make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t force your opinions on other people</strong>. Also, listen patiently to others, but at the same time don’t be swayed by what other people think you should do. Test their advice against your inner wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Inner Peace</strong> Take time to find the inner peace and inner joy that is part of your real nature, but often hidden under the layers of our mental imaginings.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to the promptings of the heart</strong>. Be sceptical of the cold judgements of the mind.</p>
<p><strong>Better to make mistakes than to sit idle.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Don’t complain, make a difference</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Conquer the angry man by love.<br />
Conquer the ill-natured man by goodness.<br />
Conquer the miser with generosity.<br />
Conquer the liar with truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Dhammapada</p>
<p>Everyone at some time wants to change the world. It is a noble ideal to leave the world in a better place than we found it, but how can we actually change the world?</p>
<p>When asked about how to change the world, great sages often reply by saying &#8211; first you must change yourself.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everyone thinks of<br />
Changing the world, but no one thinks of<br />
Changing himself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>-Leo Tolstoy</p>
<p>Knowing one&#8217;s true self is to be in our highest consciousness. It is to be free of egoism, pride and selfishness. To know our highest self is to experience the oneness of creation. If we really see others as part of our extended self &#8211; how can we not be more loving to others and the world?</p>
<h3>How To Change the World</h3>
<blockquote><p>“Try not to change the world. You will fail. Try to love the world. Lo, the world is changed. Changed forever.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>There are different ways to change the world. Some feel the necessity for political action, some feel the need for humanitarian aid. Some feel the need to convince others through word and speech. Some feel the necessity for a spiritual approach. All ways can have their value. This is a look at how to change the world from a spiritual perspective.</p>
<p><strong>The Smallest Acts of Love</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Without love, deeds, even the most brilliant, count as nothing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; St Therese of Lisieux</p>
<p>We are apt to think in terms of what we have actually achieved. We are results oriented and are impatient to see the fruits of our action. Then when we fail to see any change, we become impatient and frustrated. The spiritual approach is to aspire to do the right thing with the best motive and then be detached from the results.</p>
<p>From a spiritual perspective it is not what we achieve, but, the spirit with which we do it. If we wish to change the world for the better, act selflessly without a mixed motive of worldly gain. Our honest endeavour will make much more difference.</p>
<p><strong>Be The Example Rather than The Missionary.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Perfect health, sincerity, honesty, straightforwardness, courage, disinterestedness, unselfishness, patience, endurance, perseverance, peace, calm, self control are all things that are taught infinitely better by example than by beautiful speeches</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Aurobindo</p>
<p>Some people want to change the world from the comfort of their armchair or barstool. All they think is necessary is to tell the world where it is going wrong and what they need to do to put it right. If the world could be put right through a quick gossip and criticism of the world, the world would be perfect along time ago. Talking about what others need to do is fine, but doesn&#8217;t actually achieve anything. What we can do, is to be what we are aspiring for. We don&#8217;t have to convince others to change the world, they will take real inspiration from our transformed lives. When we are in a good consciousness, we automatically uplift others. If we are miserable and in a bad consciousness how can we hope to make the world a better place?</p>
<blockquote><p>We can change the world,<br />
But not improve it,<br />
If we do not have peace.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>For every speech about the failings of the world, if only we good do one positive deed.</p>
<p><strong>Appreciate Others</strong></p>
<p>It is our ego which makes us think that it is we who can change the world. Actually we can do nothing on our own. It is only when there is a sense of shared responsibility, a feeling of brotherhood &#8211; that humanity will make real progress. To appreciate the best in others, is the best way to encourage, and inspire them to continue doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Often we have the temptation to change the world through the path of criticism and condemnation. But, there is another way. The way of encouragement; it is a way that people are much more receptive to.</p>
<p><strong>Looking For Friends Not Enemies.</strong></p>
<p>The deepest instinct of humanity is to befriend fellow man. How much joy we can get from offering our hospitality and good will to a stranger who passes by.  When we think of other people, other nations, we always have a choice. Do we look upon them with our suspicious and fearful mind? Do we look on them as potential enemies? or do we look for their good qualities and see them as potential friends?</p>
<p>Sometimes the simplest approaches are the most effective ways of changing the world.</p>
<p>Also, it depends what we mean by changing the world. Some feel changing the world, can only involve some different political system, greater material well being. This is true to some extent. But, changing the outer forms is only part of the equation. We also need to change the consciousness of society.  If we don&#8217;t change ourselves, if we don&#8217;t bring more peace into our own lives &#8211; how can we expect our institutions and politicians to become better.</p>

<p>It is not by chance that we find ourselves happy or miserable. Over 2,500 years ago, the Lord Buddha left us this unmistakable truth:</p>
<p>&#8220;All that we are is the result of what we have thought.  If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him.  If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought,  happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him. &#8221;</p>
<p>These are the simple tips to cultivate happiness &#8211; a happiness that doesn&#8217;t depend on external circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Be Happy Where you Are.</strong></p>
<p>We often talk about the importance of being in the &#8216;here and now&#8217;. But, what do we actually mean by this? The nature of our mind is that it is often planning for happiness in the future. If we get that degree, job, relationship, if we can only move to where reasonable people live e.t.c &#8211; then we will be happy. But, with this attitude of planning for future happiness, means it will always remain elusive &#8211; like chasing a shadow.</p>
<p>We need to be happy whereever we are. Even in the most difficult of situations there are opportunities to be a little more cheerful and a little less frustrated. Don&#8217;t allow small things to knock you off balance, as this frustration can spoil the rest of our day.</p>
<p><strong>Be Happy with your work.</strong></p>
<p>A problem is that we often associate happiness with pleasure, rest and lying on beach in some far off tropical paradise. Well, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a tropical paradise. But, unless you happen to own an island in the Bahamas, your fate will place you in different circumstances. Work is necessary and  no matter how repetitive or difficult it maybe, take pride in it. Be conscious of the ability to gain satisfaction from doing a good job and serving other people.</p>
<p>There are times when we can be happy from a mundane activity such as washing dishes. It is such a simple task, but if we can do it cheerfully, (without complaining that someone else should have been doing it), then we will really be able to cultivate real happiness.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is just being aware that we can be happy even in mundane situations. Focusing entirely on the job at hand, can help us to forget the inevitable ruminations of the mind.</p>
<p>Society places a subtle pressure to compare ourselves with other people. When we compare we will never be satisfied. There will always be someone better off than us; there will always be someone who seems more successful. As soon as we start comparing, jealousy and frustration inevitably follow. Avoid comparing with others. Instead, learn the art of self confidence and self-respect.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Do not compare<br />
If you want to be happy.<br />
Do not blame<br />
If you want to be happy.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>If you find yourself subject to jealousy, the best way to overcome it is by sincerely appreciating the good qualities / achievements of others. Appreciating the good qualities of others is the best way to learn them yourself</p>
<p><strong>Smiling in the Face of Adversity</strong></p>
<p>Life has a habit of putting is together with difficult people. Is there anyone who has the pleasure of just living with saints? &#8211; of course not &#8230; If you find your happiness challenged by other people, escaping from them will merely switch one problem for another. Keep smiling, and silently offer your good will. Don&#8217;t spend your time analysing and criticising their faults. Let the negative qualities have no impact on you.</p>
<p><strong>The Heart &#8211; Mind and Meditation</strong></p>
<p>As the first quote by Lord Buddha suggests, it is our thought and state of mind that determines our inner life. If we are subject to a negative train of thoughts, we will slowly but steadily become miserable. The art of happiness is to lessen the impact of our negative mind. It is not about just repeating positive mantras by rote; We are trying to bring the heart to the fore. This is just simply the more divine, peaceful part of our nature. There are times when our heart comes to the fore even without trying &#8211; this could be in the beauty of nature, listening to sublime music &#8211; But, at times we need to make the effort.</p>
<p>Try these simple exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/basic-steps-for-learning-meditation/">Meditation on the heart</a> can make us consciously aware of this inner happiness.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/how-to-gain-control-of-your-own-thoughts/">Learning to control our thoughts</a>. Difficult, but definitely possible. There are few better things that we can learn to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>The great paradox is that by being aware of our state of mind, we can learn to be happy without reason &#8211; or at least happiness for no external reason.</p>
<blockquote><p>True happiness<br />
Is not a mental hallucination.<br />
True happiness<br />
Is not a complacent feeling.<br />
True happiness<br />
Is the spontaneous feeling of joy<br />
That comes from knowing<br />
You are doing the right thing<br />
And leading a divine life.</p></blockquote>
