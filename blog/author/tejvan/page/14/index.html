<p>In the UK, there is a TV series &#8216;Grumpy Old Men&#8217; I think it is supposed to be a comedy programme, where middle aged men rant and complain about everything from the price of petrol to the overbearing popularity of American Idol. In a way their complaints are mildly amusing, but, it did get me thinking &#8211; Is that how I want to be in 20-30 years &#8211; always complaining and being grumpy? Often we see people who, in their early life, have a sympathetic, hopeful and positive mind. But, 30 years later, those positive qualities have slowly been eroded and replaced with a propensity towards being grumpy, miserable and negative. How can we ensure that we avoid the &#8216;grumpy old man&#8217; syndrome and remain positive throughout our advancing years?</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Get Stuck in A Rut</strong></p>
<p>When we get stuck in a rut, life seems listless and boring. When there is no newness in life we have more time to observe the failings of others, ourselves and the world. If we are always complaining about the same things in life, try to do something different. Unfortunately, it is possible to develop a subtle enjoyment of being negative. The mind gets a certain misplaced pleasure by being grumpy and complaining. But, this kind of happiness is extremely limited. Look for ways to observe life in a new way; remain dynamic and don&#8217;t leave yourself time to become overwhelmed with negativity. If necessary, force yourself to try a completely new skill or activity. &#8211; <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/10-tips-to-get-out-of-a-rut/">Ten Tips to get out of a rut</a></p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Get Exasperated Over Things You Have No Control.</strong></p>
<p>If the price of oil increases, there is not much you can do about it. Just because you incessantly complain about the price of oil, Saudi Arabia is not going to start producing an extra 10 million barrels a day. If you get upset things like this, you will invariably make yourself miserable. To some extent, we have to be accepting of external things beyond our control. For example, Governments always have and always will do things which are popular; we can&#8217;t expect this to change. But, what we can do is change our attitude. Rather than getting worked up by these things, we can develop a greater sense of detachment. Don&#8217;t allow your life to be dominated by complaints on the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>Have Perspective of Young Child</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/china-man-child.jpg"><img class="float-left" title="china-man-child" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/china-man-child.jpg" alt="child and army" width="300" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>We never refer to &#8216;grumpy young children&#8217;. True, a child may may have a temporary bad mood; but, they will soon shake it off. To a child the world is simple and a place of wonder. Life is not complicated but something to enjoy. A child does not spend his time criticising things, he just plays and enjoys life. The problem is that we feel that because we are sophisticated adults we must be much better. But, how is it progress if we move from a positive attitude to a miserable attitude? It doesn&#8217;t matter how old we are; what matters is our inner attitude. If we can feel we have a childlike heart it will help considerably in avoiding grumpiness. Even observing the simple smile of a child will help put a smile on our face. &#8211; <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/life-lessons-you-can-learn-from-children/">Life Lessons we can learn from children</a></p>
<p><strong>Leave Criticism To Others</strong></p>
<p>Criticism and grumpiness are intricately linked. If we spend all our time criticising and gossiping about others, we will develop a negative mindset. The problem is that in this world it is easy to find things to criticise. The truth is we could spend all day judging and criticing other people and we would not have even made a start. The world is not going to change just because we sit in a pub criticising others. What happens is that as we criticise the world, it gives us a subconscious feeling of superiority and this motivates us to spend more time criticising. However, if we want real happiness, we have to take a positive attitude; looking for good things to encourage &#8211; making a positive contribution. The world does not need more grumpy old men. There are always going to be plenty of people to complain about the level of taxes; what we need is positive people who will help make a difference.</p>

<h4>World Harmony Run</h4>
<p>Away from the internet, myself and Shane have been helping with the organisation of the <a href="http://www.worldharmonyrun.org/">World Harmony Run</a> as it crossed through Ireland and England. The run was in <a href="http://www.worldharmonyrun.org/ireland/news/2008/0502">Dublin on May 2nd</a> (Shane&#8217;s residence) and Oxford yesterday (Tejvan&#8217;s residence). The World Harmony Run was founded in 1986 by Sri Chinmoy and seeks to offer a non political initiative to raise awareness of the message of harmony amongst different people and countries.</p>

<p>It seems in life, misunderstanding is easy to occur. Misunderstandings can create unnecessary conflict and unhappiness; often this results from a suspicious mind and unfairly assigning motives.</p>
<p>These are suggestions for preventing and resolving misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>1. Don&#8217;t Suspect</strong></p>
<p>Misunderstandings often arise because we suspect the worst. We may feel that someone has a negative attitude towards us, when actually they don&#8217;t. The mind can be tricky, we can easily build up a negative image of someone, yet, it is an impression which is false or at least only partially true. Often this stems from a lack of self confidence. Because we doubt ourselves we assume that people are liable to be thinking badly about us. Another example is when we take lack of praise as a sign people think negatively of us. Just because someone doesn&#8217;t offer praise outwardly, doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t like us.</p>
<p><strong>2. Talk honestly</strong></p>
<p>Most misunderstandings can be resolved by talking with other people. Meeting a person and talking of issues, often shows that our mind&#8217;s imaginings were quite false. Be wary of communicating via email; it is a very impersonal form of communication. There is no body language and it is much easier to create misunderstandings. Sometimes we can say something, but, it is our facial expression and eyes that offer the real meaning of what we are trying to convey.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use the heart</strong></p>
<p>The mind will always find conflict, problems and doubts. We need to use the heart and concentrate on things which unite. Here the heart is the aspect which does not judge or criticise but seeks oneness. Outwardly a person may create negative connotations; if this is the case use the heart to silently concentrate on the inner qualities of the other person.</p>

A man was going to visit his father-in-law&#8217;s to see his wife. Before going to the station, he tried to tidy up many loose ends such as pay outstanding bills cutting the grass and taking back some faulty goods. By the time he had finished his tasks, he was getting very late, so he started to frenetically wave down a taxi. After a few minutes a taxi arrived, and wanting to avoid missing the train, the man offered a $10 tip to the taxi driver if he would drive extra fast. With the taxi speeding as fast as it could through the crowded streets, he got to the train station just a few minutes before the train was due. He ran to the ticket counter and shouted.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A ticket to my father in laws&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, where is the place you are going to?</p>
<p>&#8220;O my father in law&#8217;s place, Please! Please! Quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just tell me the name at once&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am telling you, my father in law&#8217;s place. For God&#8217;s sake, quick! the train is about to start!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And the train started, leaving the man behind.</p>
<p>It may seem an obvious mistake to make, but maybe something like this could be happening to us all. <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/simplicity/slow-down-fast/#more-197" class="more-link">Continue Reading &rarr;</a></p>

<p>I have been practising meditation for 9 years. Since I started, I never recall missing a day. Meditation has become something automatic and instinctive; whatever is happening externally, meditation is a constant undercurrent in my life.  During the past 9 years, these are some of the things I have learnt from meditating.</p>
<p><strong>It is Easy To Meditate Badly. </strong></p>
<p>It is easy to sit down in meditation and spend 30 minutes with pleasant thoughts going through your mind; but, this is not really meditation. Unless there is a conscious and deliberate effort to silence the mind, your meditation is of little benefit. There is nobody who is going to reward you just for sitting in a chair for a long time. What counts is our ability to silence the mind; this is the essence of meditation, no matter what path we follow.</p>
<p><strong>Meditation is part personal effort &#8211; part grace.</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning we feel meditation is all personal effort. But, when we meditate well, we paradoxically feel that we are not making any effort at all. It feels like there is something that is meditating on our behalf. This experience occurs because the soul comes to the fore. Good meditation doesn&#8217;t involve our mind; but, our inner being or soul. This is why there is a strange feeling of not actually doing anything.</p>
<p><strong>Good Meditation Always wants to Share.</strong></p>
<p>One of the most surprising features of meditation is that when you meditate well, there is an unmistakeable desire to inwardly share this consciousness with others. There is a feeling that the peace you experience, instinctively belongs to others. It is not possible to separate the meditative consciousness and keep it for yourself. Meditation expands our sense of awareness; it gives an unexpected sense of connection with other people. This is not a mere intellectual idea of oneness; but something that can only ever be felt and experienced.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude.</strong></p>
<p>If you have a powerful meditation there is a strong sense of gratitude; this is much more than our usual polite way of saying thank-you. It is a spontaneous feeling that our meditation is a gift which we can only feel gratitude for.</p>
<p><strong>The Ego wants to Spoil Meditation.</strong></p>
<p>It is quite common that good meditation becomes spoilt by the intervention of the ego. Our meditation may go very well, but then the ego starts to spoil it by creating a sense of spiritual pride. When we feel pride in our meditation, we know it has taken the wrong turn. To meditate well, we have to give up all idea and concept of displaying anything to other people. When we meditate well there is no desire for anyone to outwardly know. Meditation is something sacred that can only be shared inwardly. In the best meditation there is no sense of self; perhaps momentarily we forget about our sense of &#8220;i ness&#8221;. We feel that the meditation is impersonal, and just about consciousness.</p>

<p>This post is based on a traditional Zen Story.</p>
<p>There was a Zen Master who used to invite his disciples to his house in order to meditate. The meditation was very soulful but unfortunately the Master owned a cat who used to come in and disturb the meditation. Therefore, before each meditation, the Master would tie up the cat to his bed; this would enable the master and his disciples to meditate in peace downstairs. After the Master&#8217;s passing, his students still used to come to the house to meditate and tie up the cat to the bed.</p>
<p>Now one seeker had to travel to another country and he didn&#8217;t return for another 5 years time. When he returned he was shocked to see that there were many more people coming to the Master&#8217;s house. However, they didn&#8217;t come to meditate, they only came to tie up cats to the bed. Even in such a short time the real purpose of the Master&#8217;s house had been forgotten. The seekers were concentrating only on the trivial ritual of tying up a cat to the bed; they had forgotten the essential part of coming to his house which was meditation.</p>
<p>This story is a humorous exaggeration of how we can forget the essence of things and concentrate on unimportant external actions.</p>
<p>It also shows how habit can be a limiting factor; just because we have always tied up a cat to the bed, we continue to do it. Because everyone else does it and we have been doing it for a long time we think it must be the right thing to do. But, of course, it would be much better to find the cat a better home and enable greater dedication to meditation.</p>

We spend most of our life talking, and yet many people remain in the dark on this essential life skill. There are many suggestions for developing conversation skills, but, the most important is a sensitivity to the other person. We need to be able to adapt our conversation to whoever we speak with. We need to develop the right balance between talking and bringing out the best in the other person. If we can avoid being egotistical and consider the interests of others they will instinctively enjoy talking with us. If we offer boring conversation, we will only attract boring people to speak with.</p>
<p>Some Tips for Effective Conversation:</p>
<p><strong>1. Avoiding Unnecessary Detail.</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you are a cyclist and a non cyclist asks you about your new bike. What they are wanting is a brief description &#8211; like what colour is it? how much does it weigh? how much did it cost? did it come with free sachets of EPO? In all probability they are not interested in your bike at all, but, are asking out of politeness. Therefore, don&#8217;t bother them with detail they do not understand and don&#8217;t care for. The 674 gram, 20 gear Shimano Dura Ace STI groupset may be fascinating to you; but, it means nothing to the non cyclist. If you go on about the technical detail it will only bore the other person senseless. If you really feel you have to share the latest Shimano groupset mechanism, at least, find another cyclist. When we talk in great detail about our hobby / work / speciality we feel we are very knowledgeable &#8211; that is true, we are very knowledgeable, but, it makes for very boring conversation. Don&#8217;t show off with technical knowledge, be considerate of the other person.</p>
<p><strong>2. Communication is a 50 &#8211; 50 process.</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is to dominate a conversation and not give the other person a chance to speak. Remember the difference between a conversation and a lecture. If you find yourself dominating 70-80% of  conversations you should think very carefully about whether you are not just boring other people. A very effective way to improve conversation skills is to ask yourself &#8211; Would I want to speak to myself? i.e. how would you feel if you came up against another person who always wants to have the last word and dominate the conversation? Unfortunately, those who love to dominate the conversation often seem the least likely to engage in critical self inquiry. Avoid the monologue, unless you are very witty or very interesting.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was impossible to get a conversation going; everybody was talking too much.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Yogi Berra</p>
<p><strong>3. Smile </strong></p>
<p>Smiling is a simple but effective strategy to improve any conversation. This helps put the other person at ease; it is a clear signal that you are happy to be speaking with the other person.  Smiling also helps ourselves; smiling gives us self confidence and helps put us in the right frame of mind. I would say it is better to force a smile than remain glum and miserable.</p>
<p><strong>4. Avoid Strong Political / Religious views</strong></p>
<p>To impose strong political  / religious views is one of the biggest conversation killers. If it is not necessary to state political views and religious views then avoid doing it. Also be sensitive to the opinions of other people, if you know someone has strong opinions on controversial topics avoid challenging them and bringing a divisive element to the conversation; look for topics of shared interest. You are not going to change their long cherished belief&#8217;s so at best it will be a futile gesture; at worst they will be upset and avoid future conversations.</p>
<p><strong>5. Criticise by asking questions</strong></p>
<p>Take a tip from great thinkers like Benjamin Franklin and Socrates. Don&#8217;t criticise directly. Merely ask questions, which sow seeds of doubt in the mind of the other person. This is a much more effective than directly criticising. With this method you can criticise without causing any offence.</p>

<p> It seems we are all striving for happiness; but, what do we actually mean by happiness? There is a big difference between a fleeting pleasure and an inner happiness independent of external events. These characteristics help to differentiate between real happiness and false happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Peace and Happiness:</strong></p>
<p>Real happiness brings inner peace. When we are sincerely happy we are at peace with the world and with our self.<br />
A false happiness will be accompanied by insecurities, doubts and worries. We think our happiness could easily be spoilt by external events. To cultivate  happiness based on an inner peace it is necessary to be detached from the worries of the mind. We should not have a feeling of indispensability, but a calm acceptance of external events.</p>
<blockquote><p>He is happiest, be he king or peasant, who finds peace in his home.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Johann von Goethe</p>
<p><strong>Pride.</strong></p>
<p>A false happiness comes from a feeling of superiority. We feel that happiness depends on proving to the world that we are better or more indispensable than other people. A close relative of pride is jealousy of others whom we can not surpass.  Real happiness takes joy in the achievement of others; in real happiness there is no feeling of inferiority and superiority, but only a sense of oneness. If you are constantly judging yourself against others, real happiness will remain elusive. If you can gain joy from others success, you have discovered a secret of real happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Praise vs Detachment</strong></p>
<p>If we are praised to the sky we are in the seventh heaven of delight; when we are mercilessly criticised we feel in the depths of hell. Relying on the praise of others can, at best, only give a fleeting happiness. Permanent happiness comes only when we maintain a sense of self esteem which is detached from the volatile opinions of the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>To live a pure unselfish life, one must count nothing as one&#8217;s own in the midst of abundance.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Buddha<br />
<strong>Success vs Self Transcendence.</strong></p>
<p>Success gives us a temporary feeling of euphoria; we have fulfilled our desires and now we can be happy. But, the joy of success is temporary and short lived. No success is permanent, and often we are often left with a desire for an even bigger and better success. Self transcendence is the ongoing process of self development and self improvement. The happiness of self improvement is not in achieving, but in the process of aiming for a better life. The joy of self transcendence is not confined to the odd victory, but, is the permanent journey of self discovery.</p>

<h4>Meditation News</h4>
<p>Scientists at the University of Oxford have undertaken tests showing that meditation can have a measurable impact upon the brain. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7319043.stm">BBC meditation link </a></p>
<p>Professor Mark Williams, from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Oxford undertook research on a group of people who practise meditation for 8 weeks. He said the course involved:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;It teaches a way of looking at problems, observing them clearly but not necessarily trying to fix them or solve them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It suggests to people that they begin to see all their thoughts as just thoughts, whether they are positive, negative or neutral.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although it is difficult to study the scientific evidence of meditation (many other variables could cause changes in mental outlook) it is not the first study to show a positive link.</p>

<p>&#8211; Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>Will Power is the capacity to do what we instinctively want to achieve. Will-power is the force which enables us to overcome lethargy, temptation and weakness. What will-power can do is unimaginable; it can illumine our weaknesses and enable us to lead the life we want to live.</p>
<p>Some people seem to have tremendous will-power, others think that will power is not within them. However, there is no reason why anyone cannot achieve greater will power. These are some tips for developing Will-Power:</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Procrastinate</strong></p>
<p>Procrastination is a powerful way to weaken our will-power. When we have the enthusiasm and determination to achieve something, we should act on our initiative and inner motivation. If we hesitate, we allow doubt to creep in; if we wait for more favourable outer circumstances to achieve something we will never succeed. Will-power doesn&#8217;t depend on favourable outer circumstances. When we have an inspiration to aim for something we should follow through with our inspiration and cultivate our will power. The best time to act is now. (see: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/productivity/how-to-avoid-procrastination/">How to Avoid Procrastination</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Never Give Up.</strong></p>
<p>Will-power doesn&#8217;t mean we have to achieve our targets at their first attempt. Will-power is closely linked to perseverance. Will-power is the willingness and enthusiasm to remain unaffected by setbacks and difficulties. If we can persevere, even amidst set backs, we will strengthen and grow our will power. Adversity is a powerful motivation for encouraging stronger will-power. An easy life will do little to grow our will power; but, a readiness to face life&#8217;s challenges is the beginning of creating real will-power.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I do not give up, I never give up – for there is nothing in this entire world that is irrevocably unchangeable.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p><strong>Be Clear on what you want to achieve.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211;   Henry Ford</p>
<p>If we are confused and uncertain about we what we actually want, it will be impossible to harness the power of our indomitable will-power. If we have a very clear focus and target it becomes easier to focus our energies on achieving our targets. If we are very clear what we want, it becomes instinctive to focus our energies and capacities on achieving it. For example, if you are trying to break a bad habit make sure you are 100% committed to changing; if part of you still subconsciously harkens after the bad habit, your focus will be split and you will not be able to generate the necessary will-power.</p>
