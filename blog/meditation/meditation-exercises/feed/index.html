		<description><![CDATA[I would suggest to everyone that they begin today to discover the benefits of meditation and that this is a good place to start. 

What is most unfortunate is that the people who need meditation the most are the hardest ones to talk into trying.
I personally meditate at least once a week and often more than that.  I have been doing this for some years now and find that I can reach the calm state of mind and body quite easily.  
This comes in very handy when I am being tested with frustration, impatience and things just generally not going as I wished.
I would suggest to everyone that they begin today to discover the benefits of meditation using sites like this one and others that are linked here.]]></description>
