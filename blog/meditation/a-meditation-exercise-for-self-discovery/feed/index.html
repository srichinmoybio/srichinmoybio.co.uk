		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I love this meditation and find it incredible to do. Would you mind if I shared this with my newsletter subscribers? I&#039;ll put a link to your site on it and I&#039;ll be sure to let them know that I got the meditation from you. Would that be ok?

Thanks

		<description><![CDATA[Hi David

For me, it helped to have a focus too. My own teacher, Sri Chinmoy, recommended that it was advisable for beginners to start meditation by first learning how to still the mind through concentration, and an object like a candle or flower can be very helpful for this purpose, or even observing the infow and outflow of your own breath :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you find it more effective to attempt to meditate on &quot;nothing&quot; or on something like a flower/candle or whatever for a beginner.  I&#039;ve never tried to meditate on the phrases or thoughts like you&#039;ve recommended.  

I did find it quite difficult to truly empty my mind when I was just starting my own journey.  It helped to have a focus. 

Thanks for the article - great perspective.]]></description>
