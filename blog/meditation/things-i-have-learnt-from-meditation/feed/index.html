		<description><![CDATA[Hi there, 

What I have learned to be true of meditation is that it is not about purposely trying to &#039;silence the mind&#039;: to do this implies going against the present moment by trying to manipulate what is happening for you in that moment. Rather, meditation can help us to witness our thoughts and become aware of them so that we are then able to slowly detach from them. If we reject them as &quot;wrong&quot; or try to battle them we are ultimately repressing these thoughts and thus less likely to be able to dissolve our attachment to them. I appreciate what you mean by these sentiments but I think you need to be careful with how you share these ideas. I feel that most meditation techniques seem to agree that when investigating the inner world we need to be compassionate towards ourselves and not see what&#039;s happening with us as &#039;wrong&#039; but rather observeand watch what comes up for us without attaching to these thoughts or emotions and through doing so being to detach and then deepen our insight into ourselves. 

Kind regards]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tejvan,

It is a pleasure reading your posts. I also have been practising meditation for the last one year. I have been very inconsistent with it. But I like the fact that is not forced upon. Could you guide me as to where I can find some music for meditation.

Thank you]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tejvan,
I am a Yoga study student and I am currently doing some research for a paper I need to complete in the coming months. I have chosen Meditation as my topic or to be more precise the title is going to be &quot;Journeys into meditation&quot; My intention is to interview a small number of people so they can tell of their own personal journeys. I want my research paper to inspire and encourage others to seek their own journey. I thought reading other peoples experiences would be interesting reading. I would be most grateful if you would allow me to present your article as part of my paper. I look forward to your reply. Could you please email me directly. thanks so much
