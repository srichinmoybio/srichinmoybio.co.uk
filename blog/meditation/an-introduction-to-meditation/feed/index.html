What&#039;s the difference between yoga and meditation? Is yoga a form of meditation?

Thanks - Matt]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I learned a lot from the articles and would like to apply meditation technique so I can really learn to meditate. I am not sure how I should start. I do see it teaches the techniques but I feel so naive in this process I think I need more guidance. I have been trying to meditate for almost a year now but it has been really hard for me. I just feel my thoughts are taking over me and I am not being able to control it. I want to start from the scratch and do anything to get that inner peace in my mind and heart. Hope to hear form you soon.]]></description>
