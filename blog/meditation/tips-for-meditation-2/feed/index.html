		<description><![CDATA[Excellent tips, I am doing meditation myself since last 6 months.
There has been tremendous improvement in myself but I don&#039;t attribute everything to meditation, I do lot of spiritual reading too. Especially Hindu Spiritual books like Gita, Ramayan, Sai Satcharitra also I read western spiritual books like Power of Now, Undoing the Ego...etc.
I personally believe combination of knowledge, meditation and good company will lead us in the right direction.
 Remember one thing we do not know our own good, lets take the path, Eshwara(god) has chosen it for us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[from this post my favorite point is dont judge your meditation. sometimes you may have profound experience during meditation and lose heart as you expect it to occur every time, but it may be some time before you feel or see anything again.

I meditate because i enjoy the feeling of centredness and oneness i get both during and afterwards, this for me is enough anything else is a bonus (though a much welcome bonus)
bless you]]></description>
