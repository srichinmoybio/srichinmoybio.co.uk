		<description><![CDATA[Anger will only mar one.  The apostle paul in his letter to the ephesians 4 verse 26, he stated clearly that we should be angry, but he latter warned us not to allow anger overwhelm us.  Taking a cursory look at ecclesiastics 4 verse 9, you will agree alongside with the bible, that anger is only present in the minds of fools.  Even psalms 37 verse 8 warned us against anger.  Mediatating on these bible portions will help us to stop been angry.  Above all, we need to pray constantly to God for help, for with him nothing is impossible.  May Our creator, whose name is jehovah remain a faithful one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was lying in bed this morning after a sleepless night of anger as someone at work had really angered me. It took me sometime to realise that it was anger that I was feeling rather than anxiety. I began to look up anger on the internet and came across this site. The great words of wisdom have really helped me to get it all into perspective, so thank you for such a good direction. Thank you Tejvan. You have put me back on track to meditate again as I frequently just fail to do it. You have helped me recognise and to deal with my anger in a wise way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I often listen to &quot;Structures from Silence&quot; by Steve Roach ... a classic from 1984 that you can get on iTunes.  (That&#039;s the name of the album and also the particular piece I use to meditate).  It&#039;s about 25 minutes long, perfect for a meditation session if you include getting ready, calming your mind etc.  There&#039;s a wonderful &quot;breathing&quot; quality to the pace of the music that really works for me!  Google it!]]></description>
