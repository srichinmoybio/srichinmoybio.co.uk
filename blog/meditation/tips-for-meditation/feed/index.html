		<description><![CDATA[Hi All,

Very nice article for people who really want to find peace and control mind.

I have a question:
In one of the blogs i read that alternate breathing should not be performed many times as it causes stress. 
During meditation it is advised to focus on our breathe, Is it fine to always keep our focus or attention on our normal breathe always while performing our day to day activities.

Thank you]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that meditation is more than just &quot;counting sheep&quot;  or &quot;enjoying quiet.&quot; It&#039;s actually a quiet, focused time.

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with your assessment that a practice must with done regularly to gain benefits. Although I believe meditation is highly useful, I also highly recommend the practice of contemplation.

By integrating our imagination - asking questions quietly and seeking guidance for instance - we come to find that there are higher beings (Ancient Ones, Masters, etc.) that we can tune into that are made available to us once we raise our frequencies (vibrations).

This is very well explained in a book I recently read called &#039;Wake Up, Your Life is Calling&#039; by Andy Feld.

There are other steps needed other than contemplation (or meditation), but going inside ourselves in some way is essential. Without this practice we are like slaves to the physical world. And that&#039;s no fun!!

Thanks for listening,
Kim]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have no doubts that Meditation is a very good exercise to control our emotions &amp; improves our concentration.

I am a self-motivative person. But I have this problem of not continuing anything for long period. I started learning about Meditation,yoga &amp; all spiritual related things... but somehow i lose the continuity after 2-3 weeks or a month. Again comeback &amp; start it after couple of months with the hope to make my life very good.

This has been happening in my life from last 5 years. 

How can I stop this discontinuity &amp; continue it for life long without any disruptions.

I need some advice in this perspective.]]></description>
