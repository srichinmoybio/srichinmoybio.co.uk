		<description><![CDATA[To put your thoughts in  control, you have to ask God to help you. In jeremiah 10 verse 23, it stated that it is not in the hands of an earthly human or man to direct its steps. This means that we need God&#039;s help in every thing we are doing.

With that bible portion, i mean philipians 4 verse 8, i firmly believe that one can control its thoughts.]]></description>
