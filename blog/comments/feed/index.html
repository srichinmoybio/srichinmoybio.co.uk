		<description><![CDATA[Hello:
I would like to suggest, for any child who has a lot of expression of anger/frustration
towards parents or others, 
that perhaps some space is needed - the feeling of space in the mind, that it is
possible to communicate.
to understand that it is quite common for people not to understand what you
are communicating right away - but to learn methods for expanding on your
communicating.
that as you work more with this, then it starts to become easier.

Often it is because we do not feel understood.   Then it is possible to think
of different ways to express what you are saying, to make it clearer to the parent.

Also, to understand that parents will not always understand us.  There is always
another opportunity.  To feel positive that this can happen.
That parents may sometimes understand and hear us, however, they still
may not agree to &#039;give&#039; us what we &#039;want&#039;.  

As a caveat, I wish to say that any child who is in an abusive or unsafe
environment, should contact a person whom they trust - at school or elsewhere safe,
and should work persistently, and calmly toward - being protected and taken care of.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This advice makes common ground but what happens when the anger is justified? What happens when someone uses your ability to remain calm to their advantage? What happens when someone takes pleasure in bullying you, taking advantage of you, or abusing their power over you? I have a hard to believing that in circumstances this advice works. Sometimes it is important to fight back, to draw boundaries, to make clear that no means no in your book. I&#039;m torn with this advice....but that does not mean I don&#039;t find it valuable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really loving this site. I have a lot of pent up anger because my last two relationships were with drug addicts and alcoholics which has caused me to become a co-dependent and very resentful and untrusting.  After reading the articles on anger and self-esteem on this site, I feel a shift has taken place and accountability for my own actions has been admitted. I did the best with what I knew at the time.  And here we are.  I can see now that all that has happened in my life has led me to this point in my life where I am able to start all over and see that it&#039;s not as bad as it used to be.  I have come a long way and have so much more hope then ever that life can only get better because of sites like this that inspire me to take positive steps in co-creating my best life. Thank you.]]></description>
