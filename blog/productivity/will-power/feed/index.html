		<description><![CDATA[Great post, especially the &quot;develop like a muscle&quot; tip.  This is directly relevant to a post I just made discussing techniques from leading psychologists to develop will power.  Interested readers will want to read more at:  http://agaponzie.blogspot.com/2012/07/developing-will-power.html

Some of these tips however seem to require willpower to implement them, such as &quot;never give up&quot;, and &quot;don&#039;t procrastinate&quot;.  It seems that these items are achieved once will power is developed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Developing will power is indeed one of the key components of success. One may read thousands of books on success, personal development, finances, etc., but if you don´t have the will power to execute, it will be just wasted time. There is a book that helped me tremendously on this. It´s from the late 1910´s and it´s kind of difficult to find, but I´m sure some googling will get to it. It´s called the &lt;b&gt;&quot;Creed of the Conquering Chief&quot; by Albert Pelton&lt;/b&gt;. I think Amazon carries it.

Many blessings,

Art Gonzalez

I&#039;m grateful to be of service.  Please, keep me posted as to how it goes!  Sometimes all it takes is one minor shift in perspective to inspire a world of change within us.

Have a wonderful day!]]></description>
