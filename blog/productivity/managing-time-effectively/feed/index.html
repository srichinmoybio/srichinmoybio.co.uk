		<description><![CDATA[Hah! How true that so many people waste years of their lives trying to be someone else, living someone else&#039; lives and goals. Sheeesh! It&#039;s just lost time and being lost in life, that&#039;s what it&#039;s all about.

Hopefully, more people WILL READ all these great tips to managing time. Because it&#039;s also about managing one&#039;s life. This sure is helpful and wise.

Keep it up! Keep posting, tejvan!
