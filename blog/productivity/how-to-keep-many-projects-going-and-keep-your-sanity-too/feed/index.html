		<description><![CDATA[All good points, I reckon. Especially the bit about re-evaluating priorities, and intuition - there can be too much attention on goals that have not come from an inspired place, in my opinion.

Great post - cheers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Something else just arrived to me on this topic - following one&#039;s intuition.

I&#039;ve noticed that if I don&#039;t try and &quot;force&quot; all of my projects to complete by certain deadlines, that they seem to naturally find a way to align so that whatever work needs to get done, I end up working on... and if I am waiting for things, the time I am forced to wait intuitively pushes me to work on something else that does not require a wait.

So long story short: Go with the flow!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great advice about starting and ending the day with meditation.  It&#039;s tempting to rush to do the day&#039;s activities upon waking up.  But starting the day on the right note can  prepare you well for any madness that comes along.
