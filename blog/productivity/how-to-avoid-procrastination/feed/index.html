		<description><![CDATA[This is a very insightful and practical article.

I observe that if people redefine the way they think of procrastination, they can escape the trap. In other words, some people continuously procrastinate throughout their lives, they feel the pain of the procrastination so much that they accept it as who they are, and therefore take away all power to change it. They label themselves saying, “I am a procrastinator and I have to live with that”. In doing this they stop feeling the pain as much because when they procrastinate, at least they could expect it and not be disappointed with themselves. At least they can be certain that they will not take action and therefore feel better about it. Perhaps one of the worse decisions to make is that of labeling yourself. If you want lasting change, you must see procrastinating as a choice not a disorder.

Thank you for sharing this productive article indeed!

		<description><![CDATA[Wow.. Although I, too, have to admit finding this while procrastrinating, this article does clarify and &#039;undress&#039; the hidden mechanisms of procrastrination to a degree I haven&#039;t been able to see yet.

Thank you for providing me with this pearl of insight. I now know better where to start working: letting go of my fear of disappointment, letting go of my requirement to do a perfect job each time.

All of what you say here apply so clearly to me, it&#039;s almost spooky. I feel exposed, but I embrace this exposedness.

Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Procrastination is a powerful way to weaken our will-power. When we have the enthusiasm and determination to achieve something, we should act on our initiative and inner motivation. If we hesitate, we allow doubt to creep in; if we wait for more favourable outer circumstances to achieve something we will never succeed. Will-power doesn&#8217;t depend on favourable outer circumstances. When we have an inspiration to aim for something we should follow through with our inspiration and cultivate our will power. The best time to act is now. (see: How to Avoid Procrastination) [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Chris
Even I found this good article by procastinating. But I would say it&#039;s worth to read this article than checking scrap on orkut. Sometimes this type of procastination could be positive on our life which realize your highest priorities.

BTW, true article which is happening with me.....]]></description>
