				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some inspirational ideas and quotes from the great Seer Poets can become like mantras. They invoke and explain powerful ideas with a poetic flow that touches the soul. These are a few quotes and ideas that have frequently inspired me. If you have any to share, kindly leave in comments.</p>
<h3>Humility</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/shakespeare-all-worlds-stage-tejvanvery-misty-cc.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="shakespeare-all-worlds-stage-tejvanvery-misty-cc" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/shakespeare-all-worlds-stage-tejvanvery-misty-cc.jpg" alt="shakespeare-all-worlds-stage" width="500" /></a><br />
This famous monologue from Shakespeare&#8217;s &#8216;As You Like it&#8217; eludes to the importance of humility. We may be proud of our current situation, but we can never take our fate for granted. It also infers the underlying oneness of experience. &#8216;We play many parts&#8217; reminds us that we can experience life from any perspective. It is a reminder of the golden rule to love thy neighbour as thyself. As a part we play today, maybe very different tomorrow. It also makes me think of Mother Teresa&#8217;s quote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8216;In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8211; Whatever our current &#8216;part&#8217; maybe, the important thing is we do our part with love.</p>
<p><strong>Love vs Power</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/when-power-love-peace.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-879" title="when-power-love-peace" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/when-power-love-peace.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">(Photo: Unmesh)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The nature of the mind is to wish to exercise power. But, when we strive for power, peace disappears. If we replace the love of power, with the power of love, the world will be changed. It is our heart power that can bring peace and not the battle for supremacy.</p>
<h3> The Nature of Love</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/shakespeare-let-me-not-admit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-880" title="shakespeare-let-me-not-admit" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/shakespeare-let-me-not-admit.jpg" alt="let me not admit" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">(photo: Phoolanjaya)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In human love there is often attachment and desire. We love, but there is a partial desire to benefit ourselves. The real divine love is unconditional. We love for love&#8217;s sake and are not influenced by outer circumstances. In real love, forgiveness comes spontaneously. There is no sense of sacrifice, only love.</p>

</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Nature of Self</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/i-celebrate-whitman.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-881" title="i-celebrate-whitman" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/i-celebrate-whitman.jpg" alt="i celebrate" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Walt Whitman&#8217;s classic opening from &#8216;Song of Myself&#8217; is a joyful reminder of our highest self &#8211; our real self. It is a reminder of the underlying oneness we have with creation. The Vedic Seers wrote many centuries ago that  our inner nature is delight. This is an inspiration for us to grow from the little &#8216;I&#8217; (ego) to the bigger I</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Beauty</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/a-thing-of-beauty.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-882" title="a-thing-of-beauty" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/a-thing-of-beauty.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It feel superfluous to add to this momentous line from John Keats. An invocation of beauty and joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Heaven on Earth</h3>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blake-to-see-a-world-flower-phoolanjaya.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="blake-to-see-a-world-flower-phoolanjaya" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blake-to-see-a-world-flower-phoolanjaya.jpg" alt="to see world" width="500" height="375" /></a>(Photo: Phoolanjaya)</p>
<p>Another epic of English poetry. A reminder heaven is in the eye of the beholder. If we can be aware and grateful of nature, we can see miracles everyday.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span id="more-681"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Perfection</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/rumi-the-fault-500.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-883" title="rumi-the-fault-500" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/rumi-the-fault-500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="323" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">(photo: Unmesh)</p>
<p>In the outer life, we see teeming imperfection. The human mind is apt to criticise and condemn. But, from a different consciousness and a different perspective we see the spirit behind the material world.</p>
<h3>God is Love</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/my-god-is-love.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-884" title="my-god-is-love" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/my-god-is-love.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">(photo Unmesh)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the Buddha attained enlightenment, he did not talk of God. He felt, the consciousness of Nirvana was too impenetrable to describe to the human mind, but he did talk of light, peace and love. What is God if not these qualities of infinite peace, light and love? God can be described in many ways, but the greatest is love. Sri Aurobindo, from his epic Savitri, epitomizes the essence of God who loves without condition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">Love is long suffering,<br />
love is kind,<br />
it is not jealous,<br />
love does not boast,<br />
it is not inflated.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/spiritual_and_devotional_poets/christian/corinthians/">Corinthians 13 Love</a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Change</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/try-not-to-change-the-world.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-885" title="try-not-to-change-the-world" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/try-not-to-change-the-world.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="304" /></a></p>
<p>Everybody want to change the world, but who wants to love the world? We can love the world, by first loving ourselves in a divine way.</p>
<h3>Hope</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hope-robin-pavitrata-500.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897" title="hope-robin-pavitrata-500" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hope-robin-pavitrata-500.jpg" alt="hope" width="500" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">(photo: Pavitrata)</p>
<p>Hope is essential in human life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Love v Hate</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/if-you-ever-dare-to-fight-hatred.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-888" title="if-you-ever-dare-to-fight-hatred" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/if-you-ever-dare-to-fight-hatred.jpg" alt="hatred-love" width="500" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Inner Peace</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/unhorizoned-inner-peace-unmesh.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-890" title="unhorizoned-inner-peace-unmesh" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/unhorizoned-inner-peace-unmesh.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">(photo: Unmesh)</p>
<p>We can buy many things in this world, but inner peace can never be bought &#8211; only cultivated by our inner attitude. But, if we have inner peace, we have everything. -<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/inner-peace/seven-simple-steps-to-inner-peace/"> Seven Steps to Inner Peace</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>There is no &#8216;right way&#8217;</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8221; I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true&#8230;&#8230; &#8216;As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Swami Vivekananda, <a href="http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/spiritual/swami_vivekananda_talks/the_world_parliament_of_religions/http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/spiritual/swami_vivekananda_talks/the_world_parliament_of_religions/">Address to the World Parliament of Religions</a> September 11th, 1893</p>
<p>For much of human existence we have been arguing and fighting for the &#8216;best way&#8217;  &#8216;the one true religion&#8217;. The problem is that we always feel it is our religion that is right, or perhaps it is our country / race that is &#8216;right&#8217;. At some extremes religion claims that all other paths are invalid. Unless you worship in the &#8216;right&#8217; way you are doomed. This attitude of exclusivity breeds pride and conflict. If only our way is the right way, we end up fighting for it. But, what if there isn&#8217;t a chosen people or &#8216;the one true religion&#8217;. If we can accept that all paths are valid, we lose that exclusivity and conflict. We not only tolerate other paths and approaches but celebrate them for being valid paths on the road of life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-304 aligncenter" title="taj_5" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/taj_5.jpg" alt="" width="400" /></p>
<p>At Sri Chinmoy Inspiration, we occasionally do posts highlighting the timeless wisdom that has come from all the various world cultures &#8211; see for examples Tejvan&#8217;s Wisdom from the Zen Haiku Masters. My meditation teacher, Sri Chinmoy, came from an Indian background and he would often write short retellings of traditional Indian tales. I happen to have been reading a lot of traditional Indian stories recently &#8211; many of them come from the two great epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, India&#8217;s answer to the Iliad and the Odyssey.</p>
<p>These epics play an important role in the Hindu tradition, but there are a lot of truths in them which are timeless in nature, and I just thought I&#8217;d select four or five of them for today&#8217;s post.</p>
<p><strong>Focus only on the important things.</strong></p>
<p>This is a very nice story from the Mahabharata:</p>
<blockquote><p>Drona was a great teacher of the warrior arts, and one day he held a test to find his best archery student. He put a wooden bird on a branch of a distant tree, partly hidden by the foliage, and painted an artificial eye on the wooden bird. The teacher called all his disciples and said, &#8220;You have to hit the arrow exactly in its eye. Are you ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. First the eldest Yudhisthira was invited to try his skill. He stretched his bow-string and was about to release the arrow. Drona asked, &#8220;What is visible to you at this point of time?&#8221; Yudhisthira replied, &#8220;You, the tree, people around me, and the bird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Step aside&#8221;, said Drona.</p>
<p>Similar questions were put to his other students and Drona got the similar answers as those given by Yudhisthira. Lastly, it was the turn of Arjuna, who readied himself to shoot. Drona asked him, &#8220;What is being observed by you?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Arjuna replied, &#8220;Sir, at this point of time only the eye of the bird is visible to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;, Drona asked</p>
<p>&#8220;No, only the bird&#8221;, replied Arjuna.</p>
<p>Drona smiled and said &#8220;You may shoot.&#8221; Arjuna shot and hit the bird perfectly in the eye.</p></blockquote>
<p>This story has a particular resonance for me, because one of my weaknesses is letting myself get sidetracked from the things that really matter. However I have found over the years that by cutting out the superflous things in my life and focusing on the things that really matter, then I can make enormous strides towards fulfilling my dreams.<span id="more-305"></span></p>
<p><strong>All paths lead to the same goal</strong></p>
<p>One of the people most responsible for bringing Eastern mystical thought to the West was Swami Vivekananda. In 1893 he travelled to Chicago to the World Parliament of Religions and gave a speech that captivated all present, in which he appealed for an end to religious fanaticism and spoke about the need for oneness between all paths : <em>&#8220;We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true&#8230;The present convention, which is one of the most august assemblies ever held, is in itself a vindication, a declaration to the world of the wonderful doctrine preached in the Gita: &#8220;Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths which in the end lead to me.&#8221;</em> &#8221; The Gita is a section of the Mahabharata which many Indians would regard as their Bible. This feeling, that all of humanity is merely taking different roads up the same mountain of self-discovery, is a cornerstone of Indian thought. (By the way, the full speech can be read <a href="http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/spiritual/swami_vivekananda_talks/the_world_parliament_of_religions">here&#8230;</a>)</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s all about perspective</strong></p>
<p>One of my favourite Indian stories is a very simple one, related by the 19th century Indian master Sri Ramakrishna:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shiva sits in silent meditation on a snowy Himalayan mountain top. Suddenly there is a great sound. Nandi, Shiva&#8217;s bull, gets alarmed and asks, ‘Where is the sound coming from?’</p>
<p>Shiva says, ‘Ravana is born.&#8217;</p>
<p>After a while there is another frightening sound. Nandi asks, ‘Now, what is this sound?’</p>
<p>Shiva laughs and says,<span> </span>‘Ravana has now been slain.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Ravana was the chief antagonist of the Ramayana, whose actions and ultimate demise takes up a huge portion of the Ramayana epic. And yet from the perspective of endless time, Shiva perceived his life and death as merely another ebb and flow in the vast ocean of time. We often blow events out of proportion &#8211; for example all our thinking is devoted to how to pay that bill, or how someone has hurt our feelings. However, when we can lift our mind out of these troughts, we gain a higher perspective and see these are all transient events that should not affect our inner calm.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to your heart</strong></p>
<p>One of the great lessons of the Mahabharata, is to trust your heart, and learn to act on your inner feelings of right and wrong. In the Mahabharata, a great conflict arises because many of the noble and well meaning characters hide behind the moral code of the time, instead of doing what they inwardly know is right. For example, one of the main characters, Bishma, takes a mighty oath at the beginning of the Mahabharata to protect the throne of his kingdom. The morality of the time stated that a warrior like Bishma could never go back on his oath &#8211; and so he stayed quiet whilst all manner of wrongdoing was perpetuated by the kingdom he swore to protect, and suffered greatly at the hands of his conscience for doing so. When you listen to your heart, you are essentially tapping into a source of great goodness inside yourself, and are intuitively able to take decisions with everyone&#8217;s best interests at heart.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/dog.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254" title="dog" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/dog.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="329" /></a></p>
<p>The very notion of &#8216;self-improvement&#8217; can often imply a deep dissatisfaction with ourselves and with life. This is rather unfortunate, because such an attitude can be pretty counterproductive if we want to change ourselves! Let&#8217;s first explain how accepting ourselves does not mean giving up on improving ourselves; in fact it makes the whole process of self improvement much more joyful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We get to set our own standards for self-improvement:</strong> Often we are unhappy because we judge ourselves by some unrealistic standard, which has often to do the expectations set by other people and society. By accepting some external guideline for what constitutes self-improvement, you are in effect comparing yourself to others.  Accepting ourselves allows us to judge our self improvement not by criteria set by others, but by our own previous marks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>We get to focus on the positive:</strong> Often we spend so much time poring over our faults and failings that they occupy our entire mental space, leaving no room for us to appreciate our good qualities. By constantly ruminating on our weaknesses we give them a kind of power and we feel more and more helpless to overcome them. However by accepting yourself as you are, warts and all, you can then focus on increasing and expanding your good qualities &#8211; you will notice that your weaknesses will decrease in strength as well. Indeed, the most effective way of reducing your weaknesses is not by focusing on them, but by invoking its opposite positive quality instead.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>We live in the moment:</strong> Self acceptance means accepting whatever you did in the past, no matter how deplorable, is done and there is nothing you can do to change it now. Any time and energy spent wondering what might have been is therefore pointless. You have to start from where you are, here and now, at your current state of development, with what you have at your disposal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>We change our attitude to the world:</strong> A poor self image leads to problems relating to other people, and excessive time wondering how others perceive us. However if we are happy in our own skin, then we begin caring less about what people think about us, and more time caring about people.</li>
</ul>
<p>So how do we go about cultivating a philosophy of self acceptance? Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create space to acknowledge your good qualities.</strong> Our mind often seems automatically geared to think of only the bad about ourselves, you have to consciously shift the focus to the good.  Even a simple five minute daily exercise of writing down the good things you did (no matter how small), or positive thoughts and inspirations you have had helps enormously.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t identify with the mind.</strong> We often see our minds as the final arbiter over our behaviour, and take anything it tells us very seriously, especially when it tells us something bad about ourselves. However a practice of meditation can help you access a deeper part of your nature, and take your thoughts much less seriously.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compete with yourself rather than others.</strong> Whether it be work, sports or any other field of endeavour, try to set your challenges not so much as achieving a fixed goal or competing with others, but more about transcending your own personal best. This relieves the pressure of outside expectation, and you will get tremendous joy from knowing that you have gone beyond anything you have previously done.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/temple.jpg"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-166 aligncenter" title="temple" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/temple.jpg" alt="temple" width="400" height="247" /></p>
<p>Haiku is a particular type of poem. A traditional Haiku is 3 phrases with 17 syllables; Haiku became popular in Japan, during the seventeenth century, and has recently caught the imagination of the Western World. Haiku gives the poet a unique challenge to express themselves with the minimum of language. There are different aspects of the Haiku which can be particularly instructive.</p>
<p><strong>Paradox </strong></p>
<p>The Haiku masters delight in the paradox, mixing the mundane with the ethereal; the beautiful with the ugly. In part this reflects the quirky sense of humour the poet&#8217;s enjoyed.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This Rooster<br />
Struts along  as though<br />
he had something to do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Anonymous</p>
<p>But, there is also the deliberate effect of mixing sublime truths in the most ordinary of everyday objects. If a Zen master was to gain enlightenment, it was just as likely to be sweeping the floor as it was meditating in a Himalayan cave. The paradox is a reminder to see the extraordinary in the ordinary &#8211; the infinite in a grain of sand.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Where there are people<br />
there are flies, and also<br />
there are Buddhas&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Issa</p>
<p><strong>Read Between The Lines.</strong></p>
<p>A Haiku is not a university lecture or list of 10 commandments; it is a riddle to be deciphered by the reader. The poet invites the reader to take the 17 words and create his own imagery and own understanding. The process of seeking beyond the literal words is in itself a spiritual exercise. There is a similarity to the zen koan &#8216;What is the sound of one hand clapping&#8217; A Haiku has the similar effect; we need to work on understanding the meaning and inspiration of the poem. It is a different experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>A flash of lightning<br />
where there were faces<br />
plumes of pampas grass.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Basho</p>
<p><strong>Humour</strong></p>
<p>A characteristic of the Haiku Master is that they never take themselves too seriously. Life is something to be observed and enjoyed; but, there is nothing we need to take too seriously, even this business of enlightenment.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;From the nostril<br />
of the Great Buddha<br />
comes a swallow&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Issa</p>
<p><span id="more-239"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A thin layer of snow<br />
coats the wings of mandarin ducks &#8211;<br />
such stillness!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Shiki</p>
<p><strong>The Divine in All.</strong></p>
<p>Zen Haiku masters rarely refer directly to God. In fact the Siddharta the Buddha preferred not to mention the concept of God, because he felt it was impossible to describe the nature of God. But, Zen masters are able to see the divine in all, especially living creatures and the environment. To a Zen Master, sacredness is not something to be confined to the temple; the divine can be seen in all.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Could they be hymns?<br />
Frogs chanting<br />
in the temple well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Kansetsu</p>
<p><strong>Impermanence.</strong></p>
<p>The Haiku poets make us aware of both the Divinity all around and the impermanence of the material world.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Mosquito larvae,<br />
dancing a Buddhist chant<br />
in the water by the grave.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Issa</p>
<p>The above poem captures many of the essential elements of a Haiku poem &#8211; paradox, impermance and juxtoposing unexpected associations. We  associate Mosquito larvae with bad things, our instinctive reaction is to want to destroy them. But, look what happens in the second poem, the poet unexpectedly brings in the joyful idea of a &#8216;dancing a Buddhist chant&#8217;. Even the mosquito&#8217;s are part of creation; they too have a role to play in life. Here the poet, tries to lift us from the realm of &#8216;good and bad&#8217; and make us aware of the underlying unity of all living things. The final line continues the theme of paradox. Water signifies life; grave signifies death. In these 12 words we have everything &#8211; life and death. But, in the middle we have the beautiful image of  &#8216;dancing a Buddhist chant&#8217;. The poet is saying that in the middle of life and death there is the bliss of creation; we just have to go beyond our concepts of death, good and bad.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the poets explicitly share wisdom; wisdom through the use of analogy. Here the concept of non attachment is beautifully explained with the simplest of examples.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By the power<br />
of complete non attachment<br />
the frog floats&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Jaso</p>
<p>We could write pages and pages of prose on the issue of non-attachment, but here the poet is able to conjure up an image revealing the simplistic power of non attachment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/sunset.jpg" alt="sunset Hawaii" /></p>
<p>A sense of perspective is vital to keeping sane and avoid small problems that can unnecessarily overwhelm us. If we lose perspective we can end up worrying for hours about things that may never even happen. To keep things in perspective it is particularly important to live in the present moment and avoid being overwhelmed by fears and concerns about the future.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to keep things in a sense of perspective.</p>
<p><strong>See Things from other people&#8217;s point of view.</strong></p>
<p>This is something that can be quite difficult to do. When we feel aggrieved at a situation or person, try to place yourselves in their shoes and try to understand their motivations and actions. We don&#8217;t necessarily have to agree and sympathise with them. But, if we can really look at an issue from other people&#8217;s perspective we can sincerely understand a very different perspective on the issue. This will help us be more sympathetic in our judgement and response.</p>
<p><strong>Does it matter what other people think? </strong></p>
<p>If someone makes a critical judgement, don&#8217;t let it be the end of your world. Just because we have received some negative feedback, it doesn&#8217;t mean it is entirely true or that we should take it to heart. Criticism invariably results from some small mistake; and doesn&#8217;t reflect on our overall character.</p>
<p><strong>Are You misjudging other people?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes problems occur because we wrongly assume other people are acting from a certain motivation. The mind suspects and assumes the worst, yet, often we are incorrect in our assumptions. If someone fails to acknowledge our presence or contribution; we should avoid making the jump to assuming that they therefore no longer like us. The mind can be very tricky &#8211; it can take a small incident and magnify it out of all proportion. It is important to be very careful in judging people&#8217;s motives, especially when we assume them to be negative. If we suspect the worst we lose something precious within us.</p>
<p><strong>Does this cause any major problems?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we can get worked up about problems that are very insignificant. Perhaps we like to keep things in a certain order, but our house companions fail to clean up. It&#8217;s a bit inconvenient if people leave dirty washing in the sink; but, at the same time it&#8217;s not the end of the world. Think about the things that have concerned you in the past few days; and be honest in questioning how important they really are.</p>
<p><span id="more-150"></span></p>
<p><strong>Detach from the Mind. </strong></p>
<p>Our thoughts are not always reliable, it is important to be able to evaluate our own thoughts and decide whether they are accurate or not. Sometimes when we wake up in the morning we have a different perspective on yesterdays problems. The reason is that during sleep the mind switches off temporarily. Therefore, the new day can often give a new fresh, more optimistic perspective. However, we don&#8217;t have to wait until we sleep for 8 hours to switch off from the mind. Through <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/an-introduction-to-meditation/">learning meditation</a> and how to control our thoughts, we can still the mind even during waking hours. If we cultivate this inner silence it helps to evaluate issues from a higher perspective. Meditation enhances our capacity to look at issues with our intuitive capacity and not just the intellectual mind.<br />
<strong><br />
Ask a Third Party for their Views</strong></p>
<p>It is said that those who need advice are those most unwilling to be receptive to any advice. However, asking others can be beneficial for seeing another perspective. It is important that we not only ask others but are willing to take their views on board. It is also important to ask the right person; someone who doesn&#8217;t have a vested interest or have prejudged the issues</p>
<p><strong>Be Willing to Think you May be wrong</strong></p>
<p>Our initial judgements are often wrong. It is a mistake to hold onto these views rigidly. Our perspective is more likely to be inaccurate and unbalance when we become deeply attached to a particular outlook. Sometimes our pride and ego can make us reluctant to soften or alter our perspective. Our ego can exaggerate our problems and blow things up out of proportion</p>
<p><strong>Concentrate on Good things.</strong></p>
<p>Another thing we can try is just to ignore the problem / issue completely and throw ourselves into something different. If we can absorb ourselves in another task then we give time to ignore the problem. Later we realise that what seemed like a big problem before, is now less problematic.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/pokaragirlsandlake.jpg" alt="lake" /></p>
<p> How often do we find ourselves struggling to know the right course of action, the right thing to say? There is no magic solution to knowing the right thing to do. But, these are a few suggestions for working out the best course of action.</p>
<p><strong>1. Listen to Your Inner voice</strong></p>
<p>Deep within, we all have an inner voice, &#8211; our own conscience. It is sometimes hard to put our finger on this part of us, which knows the right thing. To be able to listen to our own conscience we have to silence the mind and put aside the perceptions of the ego. Conscience is like a muscle, the more we listen to it &#8211; the stronger it becomes. If we value our inner pilot, it will be easier to listen to it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Does your decision bring inner peace?</strong></p>
<p>The best way to tell whether we are doing the right thing is to feel whether we are inwardly happy with the choice. As William Shakespeare suggested it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A peace above all earthly dignities, a still and quiet conscience.&#8221; [1]</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we want to do something, but feel tremendous discord and inner turmoil. With these kind of decisions we cannot get any peace of mind, but, we spend time vainly trying to justify our decisions. Sometimes we can succeed in overriding the voice of our conscience &#8211; but, this inevitably leads to regrets later on. Note the &#8216;right decision&#8217; may not lead to outer peace. Sometimes doing the &#8216;right thing&#8217; will bring complications in our outer life. But, in working out the best thing to do, we need to place importance on our inner state of mind. If we know we are doing the &#8216;right thing&#8217; we can more easily tolerate outer sufferings.</p>
<p><strong>3. Give Time for Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Quite often our initial reaction is clouded with emotion. When we react in haste, it is more difficult to know the right thing to do. When writing an important letter, always give time to revise your initial draft. Sometimes we write things in the heat of the moment, but, on quiet reflection we realise there are much better ways of saying things. If a difficult situation arises try to give yourself time before pronouncing your verdict. This is particularly true if we are consumed with anger. When we are angry we lose our equanimity and our judgement is often impaired.</p>
<p><span id="more-90"></span></p>
<p><strong>4. Are you acting out of Ego &#8211; Jealousy / Pride?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to be able to critically analyse our motives. If we are acting out of a feeling of wounded pride or jealousy it is highly likely we are not taking the best solution. In deciding the best thing to do, don&#8217;t act from a misplaced feeling of pride or what makes you look good. Try to act selflessly, when we have selfless motives it is much easier to know the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>5. Read the Wisdom of Teachers who inspire you. </strong></p>
<p>If you feel an affinity with a certain teaching / philosophy, how does your decision fit in with these basic ethical / spiritual principles. A Christian would read the words of Christ, a Buddhist would read the philosophy of the Buddha. Sometimes we read teachings of other people, and part of it really resonates as an inspired philosophy to guide our life by. Remember these particular quotes and try to live this philosophy, even in the most trying circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>6. Take Advice</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be too proud to seek the advice of others. Two heads can be better than one; for some questions it can be helpful to take a second opinion. It is important to take advice from the right people. Often the best person may be someone who is detached from your situation. However, we should not feel duty bound to follow the advice of others and society. Often the &#8216;right thing&#8217; is that which is not dictated by social pressures.</p>
<p><strong>7. Are You Happy with the consequences? </strong></p>
<p>A simple spiritual philosophy, is to act in a way that takes into consideration your neighbour. When deciding what to do, try to place yourself in the position of other people &#8211; would you be happy if behaved like that towards yourself? Would you be glad if other people did this to you? Will you regret this decision if people find out what you are doing?</p>
<p><strong>8. Silence</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes to know the right thing to do we need to speak a little less and listen a little more. Silence often saves us from having to enter into difficult and unnecessary disputes. Often problems are not helped by our intervention. Through remaining silent we often enable the problem to resolve of its own accord.

<p>I am fortunate to have sufficient time to write several articles a week on the theme of self improvement. I think the main criteria for finding inspiration is that you have an interest / passion for writing on these topics. Sometimes, it is difficult to find new topics, but these are some of the strategies I use for gaining inspiration and creativity.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<p>Many of my articles have been inspired by reading a quote from profound thinkers and spiritual teachers. For example, a very short quote by Sri Chinmoy,</p>
<blockquote><p>Not self-contempt<br />
But self-improvement<br />
Has to be our continuous choice.</p></blockquote>
<p>gave an idea for an article &#8211; the <a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/the-art-of-effective-self-criticism/">art of effective self criticism</a>. I also enjoy the delightful paradoxes found in the Tao Te Ching. For example this quote.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Master doesn’t try to be powerful;<br />
thus he is truly powerful.<br />
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power;<br />
thus he never has enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>helped inspire an article &#8220;<a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/do-you-have-the-characteristics-of-an-effective-leader/">What makes an effective leader&#8221;</a> The funny thing is that quite often I write a very long 1,000 word essay and find that it says little more than the initial short quote <img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> But, that is fine, sometimes we like the simplicity and power of poetry and quotes; sometimes our mind likes lengthy explanation and reason &#8211; both have their value.</p>
<p><strong>Reader&#8217;s Comments</strong></p>
<p>Articles can often produce intriguing comments from the readers. I like to try and respond; but, sometimes when I am responding to a comment I realise I could actually expand it into a whole article itself. I like this method of finding inspiration because it makes your articles like a conversation. I think every writer has certain limitations &#8211; I have a certain world perspective, so it is often through comments that I gain new ideas and directions.</p>
<p><strong>Answering Questions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I receive questions through comments, or emails. This often gives ideas that are quite obvious, yet are something I had often never thought about. For example, this particular article came about a readers comment about, how do you find time to write? I like receiving questions, because it provides a focus for an article. You also feel the article has a sense of purpose.</p>
<p><span id="more-73"></span></p>
<p><strong>What is Happening in my Life.</strong></p>
<p>Any genuine article on self improvement will draw upon the writer&#8217;s personal experiences. When I am working out what to write, I often try to think &#8211; what is working in my life? &#8211; what is creating problems? I feel this is the best way to share something, because then you are writing from personal conviction and can give articles an individual perspective. However, I should mention, I rarely write from the perspective of  &#8220;I try to&#8230;&#8221; Generally, for self improvement articles it is best to leave out the I; at least, this is what I am comfortable with. (with the exception of this article of course <img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> )<br />
<strong><br />
Statistics Search</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps not the most spiritual method; but, looking at my site statistics often gives good ideas for what people are searching. I look closely at the keywords and key phrases people use to enter the site. Amongst these statistics, I can often find questions people are asking search engines, and this can provide an idea for an article.</p>
<p><strong>How To<br />
</strong><br />
Simple how to articles seem to be very popular on the internet. Often when writing an article, it helps you to realise what I should be actually doing. Quite often it is easier to write an article than to actually live it; I often wish I could follow my own advice. Nevertheless, there are many potential ideas for writing how to articles.<br />
<strong><br />
Compile a list of Articles to Write</strong></p>
<p>On my laptop I save a document on my desktop which is simply a list of potential article titles. Whenever I get a good idea I add it to the list. Therefore, whenever I am in the mood for writing I always have a few suggestions of titles to choose from. As I write on other topics as well (boring things like economics and mortgages) I keep different topics within this list.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Mind &#8211; Meditation</strong></p>
<p>I practise meditation twice a day. I use meditation as a tool for clearing the mind. I find that when we are able to quieten the mind, we often discover an inner source of creativity and inspiration. Usually, our mind has many mundane thoughts revolving around; however, through meditation we can give a chance for new ideas to come to the fore. Sometimes after meditation I can write an article quite effortlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Writing without Distraction</strong></p>
<p>It is important to be able to write without distraction. I have two invaluable pieces of equipment which enable me to do most of my writing. The first is my Mac laptop (with 3 hour battery life) this enables me to write in a suitable environment, away from mundane distractions (the internet is by far the worst). The second is my iPod; this enables me to drown out any noise / chatter you may get in a cafe. For writing I choose fairly neutral, meditative music; I often listen to Gregorian chants when writing.</p>
<p><strong>Not The Internet</strong></p>
<p>As a general rule, I do not read other blogs to gain inspiration. I am always keen to maintain independence of thought and avoid imitating the style and content of other bloggers. I prefer to gain inspiration from sources other than the internet. Nevertheless, there are times when you come across exceptional / original articles and you cannot help but be inspired to consider these topics and ideas.</p>
<p>How do you gain inspiration for writing articles? feel free to leave any ideas in comments</p>
