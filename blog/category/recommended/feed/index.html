<h4>World Harmony Run</h4>
<p>Away from the internet, myself and Shane have been helping with the organisation of the <a href="http://www.worldharmonyrun.org/">World Harmony Run</a> as it crossed through Ireland and England. The run was in <a href="http://www.worldharmonyrun.org/ireland/news/2008/0502">Dublin on May 2nd</a> (Shane&#8217;s residence) and Oxford yesterday (Tejvan&#8217;s residence). The World Harmony Run was founded in 1986 by Sri Chinmoy and seeks to offer a non political initiative to raise awareness of the message of harmony amongst different people and countries.</p>
