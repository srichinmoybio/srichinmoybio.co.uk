				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="float-left" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/banks-of-rishikesh.jpg" alt="rishikesh" /></p>
<p>In many of my articles on self improvement, I often suggest meditation can be an invaluable aid to alleviating many of our daily problems. I don&#8217;t look upon meditation just as a problem solver, I meditate because I enjoy the consciousness of meditation. But, if we can gain real peace of mind through meditation, there is no problem that cannot be helped in some way. These a few preliminary steps for learning how to meditate.</p>
<p><strong>1. Location.</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, find a suitable quiet place for meditation. If it is very hard to find somewhere quiet, use some <a href="http://www.radiosrichinmoy.org/meditation_music">meditative music</a> to drown out background sounds. If possible keep a corner of your room reserved just for meditation; this will help build up a meditative vibration in that particular part.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Basics.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to meditate with a straight back. (If you try meditating whilst lying down, you are more likely to fall asleep, than entering into a high state of meditation.)</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t meditate after eating a heavy meal &#8211; you will feel lethargic and sleepy.</li>
<li>If possible shower and wear clean clothes before meditating.</li>
<li>Try to switch off. If you try to meditate straight after work, you may be still thinking about the day. Try reading some books on meditation to help make the transition from work to meditation.</li>
<li>If you have difficulty creating time see:<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/finding-time-for-relaxation/"> Finding Time for Relaxation / Meditation</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Relaxation.</strong></p>
<p>To meditate it is important to relax and switch off. Tell yourself that for the next 10-15 minutes, you don&#8217;t have to think about the past or future &#8211; just concentrate on the present moment and your meditation. Let go of any tension in your body and try to be fully aware of the present moment. This stage of relaxation is a preliminary stage to meditation; but, it is worth emphasizing that meditation is more than just relaxation.</p>
<p><span id="more-117"></span></p>
<p><strong>4. Breathing.</strong></p>
<p>The most helpful aid to meditation is proper breathing. Our breathing has a big impact on our mind; if we can quieten our breathing it will help slow down our mind. Focusing on our breathing and nothing else will have a beneficial effect on our meditation. The beauty of meditation is its simplicity. &#8211; Just be fully conscious of your breathing, feel you are breathing in peace; if you can do this without getting distracted you will be able to meditate most effectively.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Calm Mind</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you meditate, what you actually do is to enter into a calm or still, silent mind. We have to be fully aware of the arrival and attack of thoughts. That is to say, we shall not allow any thought, divine or undivine, good or bad, to enter into our mind. Our mind should be absolutely silent. Then we have to go deep within; there we have to observe our real existence. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>With these preliminary stages you can now concentrate on cultivating a calm and quiet mind. This is the essence of meditation, whatever form of meditation you pursue, they will share this common goal of quietening the mind. It is only when we can have a mind free of thoughts that we will be able to experience real meditation. What happens is that we can quieten the mind we can expand our consciousness and bring the soul to the fore. We we feel an expansion of our consciousness; when we have a good feeling towards the world, &#8211; this is real meditation.<br />
<strong><br />
6. What is Good meditation?</strong></p>
<p>We can know we are meditating well when we have a good view towards the world. If we feel tension and disturbance then our meditation is not working well. We should have a feeling of simplicity and humility; if we feel proud with ourselves this is not a good sign. Meditation aims to reduce the ego, not expand it.</p>
<p><strong>7. But Meditation is Difficult</strong></p>
<p>Many newcomers to meditation find it difficult to quieten the mind. This is because the mind is so used to thinking that when we try to stop it is quite a shock to the system. But, if we really want to do something we persevere and practice; meditation is no different, the more we put into meditation the more we will get from it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When giving meditation classes, a common issue is people find it difficult to find the time to set aside 15 minutes of the day for meditation and a period of quiet reflection. We all know it would be good to meditate, but to actually make sure we do it can be quite a challenge. Similarly, we can have the best of intentions to change some of our bad habits and wrong attitudes, but we think maybe it will be easier or better at a later stage. For any progressive change in our nature or worthwhile practise, the best time to start is always now!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Pink-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-975" alt="Pink-pic" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Pink-pic.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We might think there will be a better time in the future, but in the spiritual life, the best time is always this present moment. If we wait for outer circumstances to be more favourable, we will always be delaying and procrastinating. And before we know it, we will have given up completely.</p>
<p>These are some tips to value the present moment and take each opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Valuing meditation</strong></p>
<p>The first thing is we need to always remember the value of meditation and spiritual practise. If we see meditation as some hard discipline we need to endure, our mind will always find an excuse to avoid doing it. However, if we can focus on the benefits and joy that we will get from the practise, we will always be motivated to keep trying. Here we need to use our wisdom, we need to convince our mind that we get more joy from meditation than we would wasting our time on some inconsequential other activity. Don&#8217;t feel when we meditate we are making a great sacrifice. Our reward will not be in heaven, it will be from cultivating a genuine sense of happiness here and now.</p>
<p><strong>Change attitude to difficulties</strong></p>
<p>If we wish to start a practise of meditation, there will be innumerable obstacles. For example, we may find it is much noiser than we like. One option is to say, &#8216;it&#8217;s too noisy&#8217; let&#8217;s wait until its quieter. The other option is to say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take this outer noise as a part of the meditation practise. I shall try incorporate the noise into the meditation &#8211; learning to allow the sound to wash away.&#8221; If we can meditate with noise, it will make our meditation practise much stronger. It&#8217;s like a runner training on hilly terrain. When he finally reaches the flat terrain, the challenging hills made him stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to say no!</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, other people can take advantage of our good nature and encourage us to take on more jobs and responsibility. But, we have to learn to say no, and put our spiritual practise first. If we can lose our feeling of indispensability, we find the world doesn&#8217;t end, just because we spend 20 minutes early in the morning learning to meditate.</p>
<p><strong>Live as if it was your last day on earth</strong></p>
<p>If it was your last day on earth, how would you spend it? Would you really worry about paying some telephone bill? Would you waste it in meaningless gossip and chat? If it was our last day, we would concentrate on the important things in  life. We would suddenly be very clear what is important to us. Material possessions lose all meaning &#8211; they are merely passing things; but our inner practise, our inner faith and inner peace become all important.</p>
<p><strong>If we don&#8217;t take this opportunity, we won&#8217;t have it again</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div id="text-10">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A spiritual life means:<br />
It is now<br />
Or never.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sri Chinmoy (1)</p>
<p>Every moment is an opportunity &#8211; either we take it or lose it. In one sense, we have eternity to achieve realisation. But, if this is our laid back attitude, we will progress with the speed of an Indian bullock cart. If we get an opportunity to meditate or change our attitude &#8211; then we should take it now, whilst we have the aspiration. If we miss out, perhaps in a few days, we will lose any enthusiasm or willingness to change.</p>
<p><span id="more-974"></span></p>
<p><strong>If something is good to do, why delay?</strong></p>
<p>Suppose we have a problematic relationship. Perhaps it is partly our mistake / our fault. Quite often our pride resists letting the situation to be resolved. Rather than be willing to let go and forgive, we hold onto a grievance or sense of injustice. This can not only prolong the problem, but can even magnify it out of proportion. But, it is only we who will suffer. If we can see a way to resolve the conflict &#8211; now is the best time. If we do the right thing now, it will prevent the continuation of negative thoughts and negative emotions.</p>
<p><strong>Feed enthusiasm</strong></p>
<p>In the spiritual life, enthusiasm is a great quality. It is infectious and can help overcome many obstacles. When there is a forward dynamic movement, when we feel fully committed to making something happen, we have that intensity and focus to overcome all obstacles. However, if we are hesitant, the initial burst of energy is dissipated, we allow doubt and insecurity to enter. Before we now it, we have found reasons not to do something. We have found reasons to delay.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, we were giving a meditation class at a central location in Oxford. On the same evening as our meditation class, another room in the building was host to a lecture series which was part of an event called &#8216;Think Week&#8217;.</p>
<p>The location of our room meant everyone coming for the &#8216;Think&#8217; lecture passed through our room. We would politely ask &#8216;Meditation or Think?&#8217; (I did consider asking &#8216;are you here to think or not to think? but thought it would confuse too much) we would then direct them onto the location. One of the attendees was Richard Dawkins, who had already given a lecture in the series. (Dawkins famous for his book God-Delusion and atheist views). Like others, he briefly he popped into our room before being re-directed on to the more cerebral choice of entertainment for the evening.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what these visitors thought of our simple meditation shrine as they briefly looked in. &#8211; A picture of a spiritual master  a candle, incense, flute music for meditation and flowers&#8230;</p>
<p>It just highlighted the simple choice we face in life. The path of the mind or  the path of the heart.</p>
<p>When we live in the mind, we try desperately to work out which is the best philosophy, the right way of thinking. It is a constant process of judgement, decision and analysis. But, if we meditate and really silence the mind, we don&#8217;t feel this sense of judgement. It is no longer a question of right and wrong, best or worst; it is simply a state of being which is joyful and natural.</p>
<p>In the silence of the heart, there is a natural sense of oneness. This is not a mere intellectual belief/hope we are interconnected. It is a un-mistakeable sense that there is only one of us. And what we do to others, we really do to our-self.</p>
<blockquote><p>Permit not thoughts<br />
To come from near and far.<br />
Let your mind remain<br />
Tranquillity’s blue star.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-643-1' id='fnref-643-1'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>However, if we feel the joy of meditation, the joy of silence, we feel it is not so important as to who is right, but only to remain in this state of being.</p>

<blockquote><p>My mind,<br />
Keep your thoughts silent.<br />
Keep your words silent.<br />
Keep everything that you have<br />
And you are silent<br />
To make me and my heart<br />
Extremely happy.</p></blockquote>
<div id="bookexcerpt">- Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-679-1' id='fnref-679-1'>1</a></sup></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This exercise is quite easy and makes an excellent introduction to meditation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit comfortable and tell yourself for next ten minutes you will just focus on this exercise and nothing else.</li>
<li>Begin by observing thoughts that come into your mind. Make no effort to control or direct thoughts, just see which thoughts come into your mind.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t judge yourself or your thoughts, but just feel you are watching these thoughts pass through your mind.</li>
<li>The secret is to feel that &#8216;you&#8217; are able to see the thoughts coming from outside into your self. This makes you feel that your thoughts are actually external to your real self. You realise the real &#8216;you&#8217; is not your thoughts, but something which can view, follow and reject thoughts</li>
<li>The next stage is to let go of any thought that comes into your mind. As soon as a thought comes stop following it. Don&#8217;t pursue it any further. If you feel it is helpful, imagine you are throwing the thought out of your mind (you can feel you are just waving it away)</li>
<li>Again don&#8217;t judge any thought that comes in, don&#8217;t get annoyed if your mind creates many thoughts, just persist in waving them away.</li>
<li>Now, try to lengthen the moments of silence in between thoughts. Try to stop them coming in at all.</li>
<li>Even if thoughts do appear, feel they are very separate to you, like fish in the sea they have no effect, but feel very distant and separate. They may be there but they can&#8217;t affect you.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise is a good step to becoming aware there is more to your reality than your thoughts. Even if thoughts appear in your mind, they have less power, less hold over you. When the power of thought is diminished, it is easier to go deep into the silent mind &#8211; which is the secret of meditation.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Meditation is the art of discovering what we already have. At the moment, we are not aware of our soul&#8217;s peace because our mind is clouded by our own thoughts. Meditation is learning how to still the mind and enter into this deeper part of ourself.</p>
<p>These steps are the essential aspects of learning how to meditate</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity and Experience</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, meditation is not a complicated or intellectual subject; meditation is inherently simple. When we meditate well, we feel we are doing something natural, spontaneous and joyful. We can read many books about meditation, but to really know what it is &#8211;  we have to practise and experience meditation for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Concentration</strong></p>
<p>The first step in meditation is to improve our concentration. This is the ability to be aware and focused on only one thing at a time. When we concentrate we put all our attention into the smallest object and exclude everything else. Often in daily life, we get easily distracted; the mind flits from one subject to another. But, when starting meditation we try to keep our attention closely focused. As soon as our mind wanders, we need to bring it back on the object of our concentration. Feel like you are a charioteer, whenever the horse (your mind) veers off course, you must use the reins to keep it going in the right direction.</p>
<p>To improve concentration, <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/an-easy-to-learn-concentration-exercise/">try this simple concentration exercise</a>, which involves focusing on a candle.</p>
<p><strong>Breathing</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is more natural and spontaneous than breathing. It is the essence of life, yet  mostly we breathe unconsciously. We can use our breathing to help our meditation.</p>
<ul>
<li> A very simple exercise is to watch your own breath.</li>
<li>Feel the breathe coming into your body.</li>
<li>Take a pause to hold your breath momentarily before exhaling.</li>
<li>The secret is to concentrate all your attention on your breathing.</li>
<li>Ignore everything else, but the simple awareness of breathing.</li>
<li>When breathing in, you can also imagine you are breathing in the quality of peace.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple breathing exercise gives us something very simple to focus on. It also helps to quieten the mind as breathing has a strong influence on our state of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline The Mind</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;When you meditate, what you actually do is  to enter into a calm or  still, silent mind. We have to be fully aware  of the arrival and attack  of thoughts. That is to say, we shall not  allow any thought, divine or  undivine, good or bad, to enter into our  mind. Our mind should be  absolutely silent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-652-1' id='fnref-652-1'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>To get the most from meditation, we need to still the mind. We need to detach from our own thoughts so that the mind eventually becomes silent. When the mind is vacant and still it gives room for peace to enter. There is an old saying that to fill a pot with milk, you must first empty all the water first. It is the same with meditation, we try to empty our mind of useless thoughts, so we can make room for the peace and bliss of meditation.</p>
<p><strong>How to Quieten the Mind.</strong></p>
<p>When you first start meditation, you may be surprised at how active your mind is. But, don&#8217;t despair, it can definitely be made quiet.</p>
<ul>
<li>As soon as a thought comes, don&#8217;t pursue it. Let go. Feel it is as insignificant as a fly.</li>
<li>Feel thoughts are separate to your self. Feel thoughts are coming from outside of you. Then, even if they come, they will feel less pressing, more distant and easier to ignore.</li>
<li>See also: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/how-to-stop-negative-thoughts/">How to stop negative thoughts</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Heart</strong></p>
<p>It is hard to meditate in the mind. Instead we can use the power of the heart. The heart isn&#8217;t just a physical organ, it is in the heart that we can feel the presence of our soul &#8211; our innermost self. The nature of the heart is to experience oneness and peace. The heart doesn&#8217;t manufacture thoughts. When our mind feels it is revolving like a wheel, we can try diving into the heart. Try to feel your sense of being is leaving the brain, leaving the mind and entering into the heart. If you can focus your sense of self here, it will be much easier to be unencumbered by thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Aspiration</strong></p>
<p>My meditation teacher, Sri Chinmoy, says the real secret of meditation is not in mastering different techniques; the real secret is our own inner aspiration &#8211; our inner cry to grow into something deeper, vaster and more fulfilling. If we are not happy with our state of mind, if we really want to experience peace in our life &#8211; then we are ready for meditation. When we have this psychic urge our own soul will be able to come to the fore and offer us the experience of meditation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;How do you meditate? You meditate with  an inner cry. There should be  an inner cry here, in the heart. The  outer cry is ego-centred; it wants  name and fame. &#8230; While you are feeling this inner cry, you try  to  make the mind absolutely calm and quiet. If a thought enters your  mind,  you try to reject it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-652-2' id='fnref-652-2'>2</a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we feel our aspiration is weak and feeble, that doesn&#8217;t matter. We may start meditation  merely with curiosity. However, we can strengthen our aspiration by reading books by Spiritual Teachers and associating with other spiritual seekers.</p>
<p><strong>Mantra</strong></p>
<p>The use of mantra can definitely help meditation. On some paths of meditation, the repetition of mantra may be the main aspect of that meditation. On our path of meditation, I use mantra when my mind feels unruly. By repeating a sacred word, we can bring purity into our mind. This enables the mind to be quieter and more receptive to meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Regularity</strong></p>
<p>There are no short cuts to mastering meditation. We should see meditation like developing a muscle or learning to play an instrument. If we do it sporadically, we will struggle to make any progress. However, if we devotedly do it everyday, we give ourselves the opportunity to make progress and get stronger. To discipline the mind is not something we can do overnight. And we should never get frustrated by our seeming lack of progress. We have been thinking all our life, we are now trying to do something radically different. We need to be patient with ourselves, but also have the firm faith in ourselves that we can master our own self. If we cannot master our own mind, no one will be able to do it for us! But never feel we are a slave to our mind. We never have to surrender  to our own thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Inspirational Place</strong></p>
<p>When we are very advanced in our meditation, we will be able to meditate anywhere, be it on a plane or bus. But, in the beginning small details can make a big difference and give us an extra boost to learning how to meditate. If we create a small corner of the room and make a simple meditation shrine, it will inspire us to meditate. We can use a candle, flower, and anything that will inspire us in meditation.</p>
<p>There are many more aspects to learning to meditate. The main thing is just to start! Just try it today and make a plan to meditate everday. It will also be much easier to meditate if you can associate with other people who also meditate. They may not be in a position to teach, but it is good to gain inspiration from others who are doing a similar practise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/sunset.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-66 aligncenter" title="sunset" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/sunset.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Recently, I offered a few <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/meditation-exercises/">meditation exercises</a>. For those interested in meditation, these are a few practical tips that I have felt worked for me during the past 11 years of meditating every day.</p>
<p><strong>Great Power in Group Meditation.</strong></p>
<p>Meditation is about consciousness. If other people are aspiring to the same meditative consciousness it becomes easier for you to be receptive to it. If you are  in New York Times Square, meditation will feel practically impossible. Of course, when we are very advanced, we will have the ability to meditate anywhere, but, in the beginning we should take any help we can get. In the beginning we will make more progress by meditating in sacred spaces and with others who are experienced in meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Feel Thoughts as Separate from Yourself.</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning it is very difficult to stop thoughts coming. But, you can feel thoughts as separate from yourself. Feel that each thought is coming from outside, and you can be like a gatekeeper allowing or stopping them. For a while, thoughts will keep coming into your mind. But, when you start to feel thoughts are separate to your real existence, they lose half their power. It is this feeling of separation from your thoughts that enables you to finally silence the mind.</p>
<p><strong>It is not Like Turning on a Light Switch.</strong></p>
<p>Meditation is a gradual process. You can&#8217;t expect instant  enlightenment. It requires constant vigilance and practise. But,  sometimes when you least expect it, you will be able to go much deeper  than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>Soulful Music </strong></p>
<p>Meditation is a sacred activity. It is an awareness of a divine consciousness. Anything that turns the mind to loftier thoughts and experiences will help us in our meditation. We need to feel an aspiration to grow into something more fulfilling and illumining. Soulful music or writings by Spiritual Masters and great seekers can give us that inspiration to delve deep within.</p>
<p><strong>Try a Different Place</strong></p>
<p>We are used to living and identifying with the mind. The nature of the mind is to think, judge and separate. These qualities of the mind are the opposite to true meditation, so if you have difficulty quietening the mind, try focusing on the heart. You have to put your whole attention and concentration on this place in the centre of your chest. Try to feel that your whole existence has become your heart.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Judge Your Meditation</strong></p>
<p>It is easy to become frustrated that our meditation is not progressing as we would like. Don&#8217;t hold onto expectations of certain experiences, concentrate on being in the present moment without judgement. If we are drawn to meditation every day, this alone is a good sign. Don&#8217;t give up just because one morning it was difficult; just try again at a more conducive time.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you meditate, please do not expect anything either from yourself or from God. You will be able to make the fastest progress if you do not expect anything from your meditation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy (1)</p>

<p>There are a variety of different meditation exercises we can try. But, the important thing is not the number or type of meditation exercises that we learn &#8211; but how we practise them. The essential qualities of meditation we need to develop are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intensity. If meditate half-heartedly, we will struggle to meditate.</li>
<li>One Pointed Concentration. However, we meditate, we have to feel at the time nothing else is important. Nothing else should come to bother us.</li>
<li>Aspiration. This is the desire to dive deep within and experience a more divine consciousness. If we feel this need for real peace and joy, we will have the intensity and discipline to meditate.</li>
<li>Regularity. Meditation is an art. We need a daily discipline to improve our ability to detach from the mind.</li>
<li>Ability to detach from thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you meditate, what you actually do is  to enter into a calm or still, silent mind. We have to be fully aware  of the arrival and attack of thoughts. That is to say, we shall not  allow any thought, divine or undivine, good or bad,  to enter into our  mind. Our mind should be  absolutely silent. Then we have to go deep  within; there we have to observe our real existence. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<ul>
<li>See also: <a href="/blog/meditation/basic-steps-for-learning-meditation/">Basic Steps for Starting Meditation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When giving meditation classes in Oxford, I tell people about different  meditation exercises, Sri Chinmoy has written about. Other paths, will  have their own variations and types of meditation exercises. However, I personally find these three meditation exercises very effective. Often people report that they have good results from these.</p>
<h3>Three Simple Meditation Exercises</h3>
<p><strong>1. Concentration on A Candle</strong></p>
<p>Basically, we put all our attention and focus onto a small tip of the candle. We exclude everything else from our awareness. With this concentration we can make great progress with meditation. See &#8211; <a href="/blog/meditation/an-easy-to-learn-concentration-exercise/">Simple To Learn Concentration Exercise</a></p>
<p><strong>2. One-Four-Two Breathing.</strong></p>
<p>Many forms of meditation use observance of your breathe. This is a simple, but, powerful exercise which can absorb your attention and enable you to go deep within. In addition, our breathing can have a profound impact on our state of mind. I often use this exercise myself, because I find it very helpful.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The rhythm of your breathing is most important. If you breathe in for one second or for one repetition of the name of the  Supreme, then you should hold the breath for four seconds or four repetitions. Then, when you  breathe out, it should be for two  seconds or the time it takes you to repeat the name of the Supreme  twice. The breathing should be done  softly and silently. When you breathe in and out, you should do it so  gently that, even if there were a thread right in front of your nose,  your breathing would not move it.&#8221;  (- Sri Chinmoy, Pranayama. <a href="http://www.yogaofsrichinmoy.com/yoga/pranayamafolder/pranayama">Read More</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3. Meditation on the Heart</strong></p>
<p>It is in the heart where we find it easiest to distance ourselves from our own mind and own thoughts. The nature of the mind is to think, judge and separate. The nature of the heart is to feel oneness, love and identification with a vaster consciousness.</p>
<p>We can just concentrate on our own heart beat and try to imagine our whole sense of being is located in the heart. If you find helpful you could visualise a beautiful garden or light within your heart centre. Try this <a href="http://www.srichinmoy.tv/tv/128">Meditation on the Heart Lotus</a> Video</p>

<div id="attachment_451" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-451" title="hydranga" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/hydranga.jpg" alt="Hydranga" width="450" height="338" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hydrangea</p></div>
<p>I have not written on meditation for a while. I have been busy offering free meditation classes in my home town of Oxford and in York. I always learn quite a few things when giving meditation classes. These are some tips which will help learning your meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Regularity</strong>.</p>
<p>If we want to enjoy listening to a music concert, we can take part whenever we feel like it. But, if we want to perform in a classical music concert we would expect to practise everyday. To develop our meditation capacity, it is important to practise at least once a day. Sometimes, our meditation, may feel unproductive; it feels like we are not getting anywhere. But, these more difficult times are just as important as the times when meditation seems effortless. We cannot expect to eat the most delicious food everyday, but, still we need to eat everyday. With regularity, and if possible, punctuality, we will be able to make the fastest progress.</p>
<p><strong>Meditating with others.</strong></p>
<p>To meditate with others, we can benefit from their silence and their focus. We consciously or unconscioulsy benefit from the meditative consciousness that builds up. So these group sessions can be beneficial to our own practise.</p>
<p><strong>One Four Two exercise.</strong></p>
<p>In Meditation, Sri Chinmoy describes this powerful breathing exercise.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The rhythm of your breathing is most important. If you breathe in for <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">one</span> second or for <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">one</span> repetition of the name of the Supreme, then you should hold the breath for <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">four</span> seconds or <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">four</span> repetitions. Then, when you breathe out, it should be for <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">two</span> seconds or the time it takes you to repeat the name of the Supreme twice. The breathing should be d<span class="highlightedSearchTerm">one</span> softly and silently. When you breathe in and out, you should do it so gently that, even if there were a thread right in front of your nose, your breathing would not move it.</p>
<p>In normal breathing both of our nostrils are usually functioning. But when we breathe properly through alternate nostrils, we get immediate relief from mental anxiety, worries, depression and many other things that cause disturbances in our nature. Alternate nostril breathing is a most important breathing exercise. We start by using our right thumb to close our right nostril. Next we breathe in with the left nostril, silently repeating the name of God, Supreme or puraka, just once. Then we close the left nostril with the <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">four</span>th finger of the right hand, and with both nostrils closed, silently repeat the name of God, Supreme or kumbhaka <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">four</span> times while holding the breath. Finally we lift the thumb from the right nostril, still keeping the left nostril closed, and exhale, repeating God, Supreme or rechaka twice. (from: <a href="http://www.yogaofsrichinmoy.com/yoga/pranayamafolder/pranayama">Pranayama</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>I find it very helpful for meditation. It gives my mind two things to focus on:<br />
My breathing and counting the mantra. I find this very effective for absorption in the meditation exercise.</p>
<p>Like all meditation exercises, it is important to not just do this mechanically. It is not like counting sheep when we are trying to get to sleep. We repeat the mantra with soulfulness and the aspiration that the mantra embodies a certain quality. You can choose Supreme, Aum or anything that inspires you most.</p>

<h3>Using Music For Meditation</h3>
<p>I often use music whilst meditating. It has to be music composed and performed in a meditative consciousness. It is not the music that excites and stimulates, but the music that inspires us to dive deep within.</p>
<p>Music can be useful if you meditate in a noisy environment (e.g. student flat) The right kind of music can also help still the mind.</p>
<p>The power of soulful / spiritual / meditative music is that it has the capacity to awaken our inner aspiration. It is this inner cry that is the most important aspect of meditation.</p>
<p>Meditation and music is quite a personal choice, but it is well worth exploring.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-369" title="rainbow_flock" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/rainbow_flock.jpg" alt="rainbow_flock" width="500" height="239" /></p>
<p>A guest post by Jogyata Dallas</p>
<p>A deep meditation is one of the most beautiful and fulfilling of all possible experiences. Once we have learnt how to find our way into that inner stillness and desireless peace that is always there inside us, our life will never be the same. Here in the sanctuary of the heart, free of time and the burdens of the mind, everything is clear, everything is already done. Out of this silence comes wisdom, understanding and delight.</p>
<p><span id="more-366"></span>It is helpful  to extend our practice of sitting meditation gradually out in to the everyday aspects of our life &#8211; karma yoga &#8211; and train ourselves to keep the meditative feeling sustained as long as possible. Walking through a park, sitting on a bus, waiting for somebody, traveling to the next moments of our life, we can bring these feelings of calmness, poise, inner happiness to the fore, string them together as a necklace of  day-long happiness-moments.</p>
<p>At this stage in our practice we don&#8217;t need to think about technique or meditation exercises, but simply allow the feeling of meditation to arise spontaneously like an inner fragrance of the soul. In this way we begin to free  meditation from it&#8217;s initial dependence on our being alone at our shrine, or a special time and place, and begin it&#8217;s extension into all of our life. This is a very important next step in our spiritual journey, the &#8216;living&#8217; of meditation, for our own consciousness is the single most powerful determining factor in the quality of all experience.</p>
<p>If we practise meditation long enough, there is an accumulation of all the tiny breakthrough moments and glimpses of peace, and these gather in momentum. A wave rider makes the effort to reach and finally catch the wave that will carry him ashore&#8230;.the student of meditation also strives in his practice and eventually his own slow awakening grows into a wave of spirit that sweeps him beyond thought and technique. He finds and  rides the forgotten ocean of joy that has always been there inside him.  This is why we need to commit to regular practice, to have patience and discipline, to find and catch the rising wave.</p>
<p>At first, the experience of meditation itself relies upon environment and some combination of time, place, correct technique. But then it goes beyond these needs. We begin to realize that while our increasing moments of &#8216;success&#8217; have been possible through  some combination of factors &#8211; a workshop we attended, group practice, a new exercise we tried or inspiring music &#8211; in reality they merely reconnected us with our deeper self, and that &#8216;self&#8217; is always there inside us, where ever we are.</p>
<p>Each human soul is so very powerful. Consider the impact of Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela, Mikhail Gorbachev , or the great spiritual masters. They come to embody values and principles that transcend and outlive their own lives, personify qualities that inspire all of humanity. I always marvelled at how my own teacher, Sri Chinmoy, would walk alone on to a concert stage before audiences of up to 18,000 people, fold his hands together over his heart  and simply by standing there , through the force of his love and the power of his meditation, bring a hushed, pin-drop silence to the entire auditorium. His  tranquility and the great achievement of his realization were felt by everyone and for many would be life-changing.</p>
<p>Each one of us also has that same potential to change the world, for as Sri Chinmoy once said , &#8216;every human being is a very special dream of God&#8217;. Someone who has great inner peace or love or compassion can walk into a room and change the whole feeling there, simply through the power of consciousness. They embody and radiate some unique beauty of the soul, teach us about our own possibilities. And that is why many students of meditation will often seek a Guru or an advanced  teacher &#8211; through even one encounter with an enlightened being we can see first-hand what is also possible for us. Their detachment and poise, their unconditional love, their freedom from suffering, their oneness with God, these will one day be our own achievement.</p>
<p>Meditation takes us past our identification with our body, thoughts, personality to a deeper understanding of our true nature. The space in our lives where we put aside the burdens and preoccupations of the day’s dramas, silence our thoughts, venture past the many attachments and distractions of the mind to a growing stillness, this space allows us to rediscover the very source of all our creative, intuitive, spiritual capacities. The closer we move towards this ‘intelligence of silence’, our ‘inner pilot’, the more perfect our outer lives become.</p>
<p>Meditation comes easily today, sitting on the grass in a park in Auckland under a wide blue summer sky, a sky of such startling clarity and endless transparency as to illumine things and gather close  the silhouettes of far-off, unfamiliar mountains. There is this lovely sense of stepping outside of the story of one&#8217;s life into a state of just   &#8216;being&#8217;,  at rest in the here and now, a lovely inner space of pure consciousness. Over in the western corner of the park the tai-chi practitioners are also touching the lives of passers-by and strollers with their children, their calm and gentle movements reminding of other realities beyond the ordinary. And I remember Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s words, reminding us that we co-create this world, that &#8216; <em>just one smile immensely increases the beauty of the universe&#8217;.</em></p>
