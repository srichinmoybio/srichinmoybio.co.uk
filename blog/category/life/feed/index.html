				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can feel the world is awash with negativity. If we are not careful we can allow this negativity into us and it will cloud our view of life. Never underestimate the power of negativity and positive thoughts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Each positive thought<br />
Has the atom-bomb-capacity<br />
To destroy the negative in us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Each negative thought<br />
Has the atom-bomb-capacity<br />
To destroy our whole world.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p>To overcome negativity in ourself, in other people, there are many things we can do.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/happy-do-you-want-pavitrata.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-934" alt="negativitiy-poem" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/happy-do-you-want-pavitrata.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t cherish negativity</strong></p>
<p>Often we unconsciously cherish negativity. We get a subtle temptation to enjoy gossip and complain. This may start off as an innocent joke, but it can grow and we become more and more negative because we focus on it. Sometimes, we need to be aware that negativity is a trait we can consciously hold onto. If we first become aware, we can change.</p>
<p><strong>The mind is like blotting paper</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna once observed that the human mind is like blotting paper &#8211; it absorbs whatever it is dipped into. If we surround ourselves with a negative environment, then this will seep into us. For example, if you find yourself reading newspaper comments section, internet forums, you expose yourself to vast quantities of negativity. This seeps into your mind, and you start subconsciously picking up on all the negativity yourself. It&#8217;s impossible not to be affected to some extent. However,  if you spend time in a very different environment, where there is a positive energy, you will definitely feel the difference &#8211; enabling you to feel positive about yourself and the world.</p>
<p><strong>Get out of ruts</strong></p>
<p>Negativity is often the result of getting stuck in a rut &#8211; getting stuck in a bad habit. If we have the same routine, the mind gets into a rhythm of complaining. Sometimes, we need to work hard to get out of a rut. Do something out of the ordinary, and break your old habits. This breaks the cycle of negativity and gives a sense of newness. In this newness, you can much more easily get out of your negativity.</p>
<p><strong>But, the problem is other people….</strong></p>
<p>If you feel that the problem is always other people, you can be assured it isn&#8217;t. It is true, we need to avoid unnecessarily negative situations. But, ultimately, we have to be aware it is only ourself who can choose to be negative or positive. Other people will always have failings, limitations and degrees of negativity. But, that is not an excuse for us to accept their negativity. Just because other people are enjoying negativity, doesn&#8217;t mean we have to.<span id="more-995"></span></p>
<h3>Staying positive in a sea of negativity.</h3>
<p>In theory, it&#8217;s easy to say &#8216;stay positive and cheerful&#8217; &#8211; whatever other people do. But, in practise, it can be a little more difficult! What practical steps can we take?</p>
<ul>
<li>Always create time for yourself. For example, a <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/basic-steps-for-learning-meditation/">daily meditation</a> routine. This is the chance to invoke peace and inner happiness. In these moments, remind yourself, you can always choose to be grateful for the opportunity for inner happiness. Just the act of reminding yourself of what you want will give you some reserves to reject the negativity, you will face later in the day.</li>
<li>Let things flow. A real secret of life is learning to let things go. Don&#8217;t magnify small problems. Feel like negativity is impermanent, and can wash away. Don&#8217;t dwell on negativity, spending energy complaining about others negativity &#8211; then there will be no end. Just see it is a fleeting, passing emotion you can let go. Instead, concentrate on enjoying the positive, something in the present moment.</li>
<li>Invoke the positive. It may sound a little trite to say, the secret of avoiding negativity is to concentrate on the opposite. But, it is still true. In stagnation, negativity will become stronger. With a sense of dynamism, and positive energy, negativity gets dissipated. This is the most effective way. Don&#8217;t fight negativity, just ignore it by welcoming the opposite.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Positive feelings<br />
Can compel negative thoughts<br />
To starve.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy [2]</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember the good qualities of people. The easiest thing is to fixate on the mistake and weaknesses of other people. If you observe someone&#8217;s fault, also insist that you remember something very good about them. This is an excellent practice for avoiding a negative spiral.</li>
<li>Be grateful it&#8217;s not any worse. Sometimes we get annoyed over really trivial things. We may have to wait in a queue, we have to clean up some mess, but we can still remind ourselves of all the things to be grateful for. Spending a few minutes over a minor inconvenience is not such a problem compared to the difficulties other people face.</li>
<li>Change the conversation. Many people will bring up some complaint or negativity in conversation. It is up to us how we respond. It is easy to join in the self-righteous indignation and negativity. But, also we can bring up a completely different topic, which invokes a positive energy. If someone is in a negative frame of mind, there is always going to be something they can be cheerful about that. Ignore their negative chain of thought. Instead mention an achievement they have recently done or inspiring piece of news. Here you are forcing them to forget about their negativity. If you can help others to escape negativity, you will definitely see a great change in your own consciousness. The important thing is you don&#8217;t directly challenge someone &#8211; &#8216;stop being negative&#8217; doesn&#8217;t work so well. But, mention their achievements, and they will become positive (mostly anyway!). When they are in a good frame of mind, it is then a better energy to deal with their area of concern or negativity.</li>
<li>Be a problem solver. It is very easy to list the reasons to be negative. It is very easy to find fault. But, negativity never solves any problem. If a situation looks bleak, what is the best way forward? No matter how bad things may appear, there is always a way to make gradual progress and ameliorate the situation. This is the secret of successful and courageous people. Whatever the situation take a calm look at the best thing you can do. If you trying to improve a very difficult situation, this positive effort is a reason for you to be positive &#8211; no matter how bad the external situation is.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t expect. Sometimes we are negative because we have unreasonable expectations. When these expectations aren&#8217;t fulfilled we become negative. Avoid preconceptions and it is easy to avoid negativity for failed expectation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real happiness and genuine spiritual progress requires an ability and willingness to be honest with ourselves. We could call it self-criticism, but I prefer honesty. If we can be honest about our motives and actions, we will learn to cultivate a more self-giving attitude and keep our ego in check.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/every-day-only-one-thing-honestly-happy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-992" title="every-day-only-one-thing-honestly-happy-menaka-photo" alt="every-day-only-one-thing-honestly-happy-menaka-photo" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/every-day-only-one-thing-honestly-happy.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This self-awareness and personal honesty, doesn&#8217;t mean we have to be overly critical of ourselves. We are not trying to make ourselves feel guilty; it is not about confessing sins, but a willingness to understand our true motivations and be aware of our shortcomings. If we always live with an attitude of self-justification and feel we are always right, we will struggle to make any real progress and will be more prone to pride and insecurity. But, if we can be honest and aware of our shortcomings, we can become the person we really want to. It may be a little hard work, but it will pay off in the long run!</p>
<p>These are some exercises we can take to make sure we are not living in a bubble.</p>
<p><strong>1. Motive.</strong> Before undertaking an action what is the motive behind it? If we are undertaking an action, why are we doing it? Would we still do it if nobody was aware of it? It is not wrong to welcome appreciation of others. But, if our action is only motivated by the desire to please others or show off, then we are only feeding our ego and it can cause problems. A pure motive helps us to transcend the ego and we gain satisfaction from extending our sense of oneness.</p>
<p><strong>2. Criticism?</strong> Do we put other people down to make us feel better? There is a part of us that tries to bolster our self-esteem by feeling better than others. This can make us critical of other people. We may not even be aware we are doing this, unless we can be really honest about our motives. Instead, we should feel our self-esteem can be built by encouraging and being sympathetic to others. It means avoiding the temptation to jump onto a train of gossip. It means we need to cultivate more self-belief and self-confidence.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do we spend too much time making excuses?</strong></p>
<p>It is human nature to try and blame our misfortune on other people and outer circumstances. But, shifting the blame onto other people is often a clever way of hiding our own shortcomings. Sometimes we think that only if we can move away from people who make life difficult for us, everything will be OK. But, when we do move somewhere else, we find the same problems are just as prominent. This is because the weakness is stemming from ourselves. We only see the our limitations reflected in other people.</p>
<dl>
<dt style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The only devils in this world are those running around in our own hearts, and that is where all our battles should be fought.&#8221;</dt>
<dt>- Mahatma Gandhi</dt>
</dl>
<p>If we are prone to anger, we can always blame the situation and the actual trigger for our anger. But, this will never deal with the underlying problem. Instead, we should make a conscious decision to overcome anger, and bring peace into our system. Here honesty is helping us to become aware of our shortcomings and helps us to realise that it is up to us to decide what will causes us to lose our inner peace. <span id="more-991"></span></p>
<p><strong>4. Do we seek flattery / sympathy?</strong> Are we looking for sympathy / praise? Sometimes we go &#8216;fishing&#8217; for sympathy or praise.  If we subconsciously seek sympathy, this can encourage a sense of self-pity and weakness. If we have misfortune, is part of us enjoying the sympathy we get? We have to keep asking ourselves, are we trying our hardest to create a positive outcome?</p>
<p><strong>5. False modesty.</strong> Do we make a big show of trying to prove our humility and modesty? Humility does not mean making ourselves invisible, humility means accepting with good grace what life puts on our plate. Sometimes, when we try to be humble, it is a false humility, and really it is our ego that is seeking reassurance. Real modesty and humility means we try to maintain an attitude of gratitude for whatever role we need to play on life&#8217;s stage.</p>
<p>There is a fine line between genuine self-awareness and being too harsh on ourselves. But, honesty and a mindfulness of our state of being</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We often cherish insecurity without being fully aware of it. Insecurity about what people think of us is quite common and it can lead to unnecessary problems. When we are insecure, it tends to make us more suspicious, it makes us try harder to impress. Because we are insecure about ourselves, we lose the self-confidence to be true to our real nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/beach-jowan.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-988" alt="beach-jowan" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/beach-jowan.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">A oneness-heart<br />
Cures<br />
Insecurity-fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p>These are some steps to overcoming insecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Recognise the problem and make an effort to overcome</strong></p>
<p>The first thing is that people may not realise a lot of their anxieties, worries and fears stem from a sense of insecurity about ourselves. We worry because we are insecure about our standing in society and amongst friends. When we are aware of a misplaced insecurity, it becomes much easier to try and overcome it. This requires an awareness and honesty about our motivations and actions.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t be overly critical of other people.</strong></p>
<p>If you spend time criticising and judging other people, you will subconsciously fear the same treatment yourself. Invariably highly critical people have a deep seated insecurity themselves. The motivation to criticise comes from a need to make themselves feel superior to other people. However, the attempt to make yourself feel better by putting other people down will never work. At best, we get a temporary false sense of security, but it never lasts. If we want to create a genuine sense of self-belief and self-confidence, never base it on being superior to others. In fact it is the opposite, if we can have a sympathetic and empathetic attitude, we will feel better ourselves. <span id="more-987"></span></p>
<p><strong>People think about you much less than you imagine.</strong></p>
<p>We often feel that people are constantly thinking about us. We worry what they might be saying. But, often people think about us much less than we imagine. Even if people do gossip, it doesn&#8217;t mean much and it will soon pass. If you are the subject of gossip, look upon it as a tiny insect crawling over an elephant. The elephant remains unmoved and the insect soon gives up trying to bother the elephant.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t dwell on mistakes</strong></p>
<p>We all make mistakes and errors of judgement. But, if we focus on this too much, it can magnify the problem and we will just develop more insecurity. Guilt is especially a damaging emotion because we feel bad. Guilt makes us seek redemption and people&#8217;s approval. But, it is better just to let go misplaced feelings of guilt. The best way to move on from past mistakes, is simply to be active and dynamic. If we brood over the past, our insecurity will never end. But, if we can take even a small positive step, our self-confidence will improve.</p>
<p><strong>Concentrate on the opposite</strong></p>
<p>If we are prone to insecurity, take the time to concentrate on the opposite. Remember our good qualities. If we can cherish a few positive thoughts, it is the best and most effective way to wash away some of our insecurities. Rather than fight, just embrace the alternative.</p>
<p><strong>The heart unites, the mind divides</strong></p>
<p>The mind divides us from other people. It is the mind and our ego which constantly play the game of superiority and inferiority. However, if we bring the qualities of the heart forward, we can develop a sense of oneness with other people. We won&#8217;t feel insecure when we feel a kinship with other people.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to be detached about judgement</strong></p>
<p>Everyone gets judged by all and sundry. Sometimes it may have a degree of truth, sometimes not. It is important to be detached and let this judgement go. It doesn&#8217;t affect who we are, but if we keeping thinking about adverse judgements, it can bind us and make us feel inadequate. When we learn to be detached, we will feel more secure about ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t feel the need to explain or defend yourself.</strong></p>
<p>A good practise to overcome insecurity, is making a point of not feeling the need to explain or defend yourself. Insecurity is really a form of pride in disguise. If we let got of our pride, we don&#8217;t have any reason to be insecure. Also, if you have done something good, avoid the temptation to tell everybody about it. Invariably people will find out anyway. But, it is much better to have the confidence to concentrate on doing the good things without the need for approval. This will lessen our insecurity because we are basing our satisfaction on the intrinsic act rather than waiting for flattery.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When giving meditation classes, a common issue is people find it difficult to find the time to set aside 15 minutes of the day for meditation and a period of quiet reflection. We all know it would be good to meditate, but to actually make sure we do it can be quite a challenge. Similarly, we can have the best of intentions to change some of our bad habits and wrong attitudes, but we think maybe it will be easier or better at a later stage. For any progressive change in our nature or worthwhile practise, the best time to start is always now!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Pink-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-975" alt="Pink-pic" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Pink-pic.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We might think there will be a better time in the future, but in the spiritual life, the best time is always this present moment. If we wait for outer circumstances to be more favourable, we will always be delaying and procrastinating. And before we know it, we will have given up completely.</p>
<p>These are some tips to value the present moment and take each opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Valuing meditation</strong></p>
<p>The first thing is we need to always remember the value of meditation and spiritual practise. If we see meditation as some hard discipline we need to endure, our mind will always find an excuse to avoid doing it. However, if we can focus on the benefits and joy that we will get from the practise, we will always be motivated to keep trying. Here we need to use our wisdom, we need to convince our mind that we get more joy from meditation than we would wasting our time on some inconsequential other activity. Don&#8217;t feel when we meditate we are making a great sacrifice. Our reward will not be in heaven, it will be from cultivating a genuine sense of happiness here and now.</p>
<p><strong>Change attitude to difficulties</strong></p>
<p>If we wish to start a practise of meditation, there will be innumerable obstacles. For example, we may find it is much noiser than we like. One option is to say, &#8216;it&#8217;s too noisy&#8217; let&#8217;s wait until its quieter. The other option is to say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take this outer noise as a part of the meditation practise. I shall try incorporate the noise into the meditation &#8211; learning to allow the sound to wash away.&#8221; If we can meditate with noise, it will make our meditation practise much stronger. It&#8217;s like a runner training on hilly terrain. When he finally reaches the flat terrain, the challenging hills made him stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to say no!</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, other people can take advantage of our good nature and encourage us to take on more jobs and responsibility. But, we have to learn to say no, and put our spiritual practise first. If we can lose our feeling of indispensability, we find the world doesn&#8217;t end, just because we spend 20 minutes early in the morning learning to meditate.</p>
<p><strong>Live as if it was your last day on earth</strong></p>
<p>If it was your last day on earth, how would you spend it? Would you really worry about paying some telephone bill? Would you waste it in meaningless gossip and chat? If it was our last day, we would concentrate on the important things in  life. We would suddenly be very clear what is important to us. Material possessions lose all meaning &#8211; they are merely passing things; but our inner practise, our inner faith and inner peace become all important.</p>
<p><strong>If we don&#8217;t take this opportunity, we won&#8217;t have it again</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div id="text-10">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A spiritual life means:<br />
It is now<br />
Or never.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sri Chinmoy (1)</p>
<p>Every moment is an opportunity &#8211; either we take it or lose it. In one sense, we have eternity to achieve realisation. But, if this is our laid back attitude, we will progress with the speed of an Indian bullock cart. If we get an opportunity to meditate or change our attitude &#8211; then we should take it now, whilst we have the aspiration. If we miss out, perhaps in a few days, we will lose any enthusiasm or willingness to change.</p>

<p><strong>If something is good to do, why delay?</strong></p>
<p>Suppose we have a problematic relationship. Perhaps it is partly our mistake / our fault. Quite often our pride resists letting the situation to be resolved. Rather than be willing to let go and forgive, we hold onto a grievance or sense of injustice. This can not only prolong the problem, but can even magnify it out of proportion. But, it is only we who will suffer. If we can see a way to resolve the conflict &#8211; now is the best time. If we do the right thing now, it will prevent the continuation of negative thoughts and negative emotions.</p>
<p><strong>Feed enthusiasm</strong></p>
<p>In the spiritual life, enthusiasm is a great quality. It is infectious and can help overcome many obstacles. When there is a forward dynamic movement, when we feel fully committed to making something happen, we have that intensity and focus to overcome all obstacles. However, if we are hesitant, the initial burst of energy is dissipated, we allow doubt and insecurity to enter. Before we now it, we have found reasons not to do something. We have found reasons to delay.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humility is a wonderful quality. People are definitely attracted to humility and often repelled by the opposite. If we can learn to value humility, we will gain real joy and improve our relationships with others tremendously. But, what is humility? What does it mean to be humble?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Jai-Ganga-Ma.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-509" alt="Jai-Ganga-Ma" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Jai-Ganga-Ma.jpg" width="333" height="283" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Giving joy to others</strong>. This is a striking definition of humility. We simply choose and attitude that helps to give joy to other people. It means avoiding meanness and jealousy, but seeking to help others to be happy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;&#8230;True humility is something totally different; it is the feeling of oneness. Humility means giving joy to others. If you have not established or cannot establish your inner oneness with others, then you can try to make them feel that they are as important as you, if not more so. &#8220;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Sri Chinmoy &#8220;Does humility mean taking a back seat&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/god-lover-earth-heaven-life-1/15-question-does-humility-mean-taking-a-back">A God-lover heaven-life part 1</a></p>
<p><strong>Bringing others forward.</strong> Real humility will make others feel good. It requires us to always value the achievements and contributions of others. Even if they have unfortunate experiences or less talent, we will still try to bring them forward and make them feel valued. This is very important because when we try to sincerely value others, we reduce our own feelings of self-importance and ego.</p>
<p><strong>Modesty</strong>. Taking a back seat is not necessary humility. Sometimes, we make a big fuss of taking the back seat &#8211; almost unconsciously, we are wanting to show others that we are being humble; we try to make a display of our humility. But, sometimes, it might be necessary to stand in the limelight. The important thing is not to see it as a show of superiority. We can feel part of an integral team,  but with someone having to be the figurehead. Humility means we are willing to play many different roles, each role with the same detachment and modesty.</p>
<h3>Real tests of humility</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong> Be equal in your affection.</strong> It is easy to bring people we like to the fore, but humility means we need to be equally fair in our treatment. We need to be willing to bring anyone to the fore, even those who we may not instinctively like. Remember the test of humility &#8211; can you give joy to others &#8211; that includes those whom you really might not want to. <span id="more-962"></span></li>
<li><strong>To take praise and blame with calmness</strong>. This is a real test of humility. If we are blamed, we shouldn&#8217;t make a great show of remorse and guilt. We can just quietly resolve to make the best efforts to avoid a similar situation in the future. Equally, if things go well, perhaps we can take time to appreciate our good luck or the contributions of others. Humility means we recognise the world doesn&#8217;t revolve around us. If something goes well, it is the achievement of many. If things go badly, we are not wholly responsible either. The only thing we have to work on is our attitude. Again, humility is about trying to give others joy. If we burden ourselves with remorse and become depressed, we make it difficult for others around us. An attitude of humility, means we need to stay positive, even if our ego takes a battering.</li>
<li><strong>Recognise you might need to take many different roles</strong>. Sometimes, we want to pigeon hole ourselves. We might think we are &#8216;above&#8217; a &#8216;demeaning job&#8217; like cleaning the toilets. Equally, we might thing we are &#8216;below&#8217; a leadership role. Humility, means that we might have to accept either role. Never feel superior or inferior to a job. Many spiritual Masters have given their disciples so called &#8216;demeaning job&#8217;s&#8217; a reminder that if we can do the simplest job with care and pride, we can make great progress. But, equally, if you are thrust forward into the limelight &#8211; remember the test of humility &#8211; can I give joy to others? If you have talents or capacity, then you are in a position to be of service and give joy to others. Hiding these talents out of a false sense of humility will prevent others gaining the joy.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See, on how many occasions you can give joy to others, and you may be pleasantly surprised that you find joy yourself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s easy to be critical of the world, but it&#8217;s much more difficult to deal with criticism directed at ourselves. Criticism is something we often like to give, but not really receive. However, no matter how saintly we might or might not be, we will get plenty of practise for dealing with criticism at some stage of our lives. When we are faced with criticism it can be an unpleasant experience, but equally if we take it with the right spirit, we can use it all for our advantage.</p>
<p>These are some tips for dealing with criticism.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/how-to-overcome-criticism.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-959" title="how-to-overcome-criticism" alt="how-to-overcome-criticism" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/how-to-overcome-criticism.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p><strong>1. Take a deep breath and don&#8217;t react.</strong> The problem with criticism is that we can feel an instinctive need to defend ourselves and argue. Often this is not necessary. Remember to separate your ego from the real self. If you are hurt by criticism, just remind yourself that it is only your ego that is hurt. Who you are really are &#8211; the soul &#8211; is not affected in anyway. With time, you will be able to respond in a more measured, positive way.</p>
<p><strong>2. Separate emotion and substance</strong> What can you learn from the criticism? Sometimes, useful suggestions are given in the form of criticism. If we strip away the other persons&#8217; emotion and unfortunate choice of words, there may be some suggestions and advice that we can usefully take on board. It is a good lesson to let go of our pride and see wisdom, even in a disguised form.</p>
<p><strong>3. Life isn&#8217;t about immediate perfection</strong>. Sometimes we set up a false goal of perfection, but life isn&#8217;t like this. It is impossible to get things 100% right all the time. The real perfection is making continued progress throughout life. To make progress, mistakes and faults are an inevitability. We should see criticism in this light of the necessary process of transformation and progress. Here we are simply changing our perspective to criticism. Rather than seeing criticism as a bad thing, we see it is part of our journey.</p>
<p><strong>4. Tough love</strong>. There are many stories of spiritual Masters who seek to perfect their disciples through tough love. If they only praised their disciples, their ego would just grow and they would fail to make spiritual progress. However, through criticising their weaknesses, it gives a chance for the aspirant to break down their ego and bring their higher self to the fore. A realised soul will be completely unaffected by criticism because he is secure in knowing who he is. He doesn&#8217;t feel the need to defend himself because he has attained a state of consciousness that is unaffected by the world. This is what we can also strive to aim for &#8211; the equanimity and inner poise to deal with any criticism of the ego.</p>
<p><strong>5. Don&#8217;t feel guilty</strong>. A deep and often misplaced sense of guilt is the worst way to take criticism. When we feel guilty, we feel unhappy and it is like placing a large stone around our neck. If we avoid feelings of guilt, it is much easier to take a positive and constructive approach. If we can remain happy and detached, then we will have the inspiration to make a better effort. But, if we react to criticism with guilt and misery, it will compound any problem. (<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/overcoming-persistent-guilt/">overcoming guilt</a>)</p>
<p><strong>6. Keep a sense of balance</strong>. It is human nature to focus on the faults of other people and what is wrong. Unfortunately, people often criticise the 1% of things that are done wrong, but fail to mention the 99% of things that you do well. If you find yourself criticised, don&#8217;t forget to remember the positive things that you have done. Perhaps you might even be able to mention that when responding politely to their criticism. But, equally, don&#8217;t instantly dismiss criticism. It is unhelpful to feel useless or invincible and always right. In reality, it is always somewhere in between.</p>
<p><strong>7. Criticism can be beneficial</strong>. Every time people criticise you outwardly, you can guarantee that silently they have been criticising you inwardly a lot more. Sometimes it is better to be open to criticism (or lets call it constructive advice)  If people feel there is a forum for airing grievances, this will help improve relationships. If you can&#8217;t take criticism in any form, people may stop outwardly criticising you, but they will build up inner resentment, which is even worse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was young, I was often asked &#8211; what do you want to be when you grow up? The answer people were looking for was something along the lines of &#8211; stockbroker or management consultant.  This is what we can grow up thinking life is all about &#8211; what can we become? how will we be perceived by society? Because of these subtle pressures, we can unconsciously start to define ourselves by the job we hold or our status in society.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/do-you-know-what-i-want-t-be.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-955" alt="what-i-want-to-be" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/do-you-know-what-i-want-t-be.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>But, imagine we could start with a clean sheet of paper and we had the opportunity to create the person we really want to be. What do we consider important? What qualities would we like to have? What aspects of ourselves would we want to transform?</p>
<p>This exercise is not about creating outer circumstances and outer status, it is about thinking about the person we want to be.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, transformation is not easy. But, if we don&#8217;t have a clear idea of where we want to go, it is nearly impossible. If we can challenge ourselves to keep asking &#8211; what do we want to be? then we can at least have a clear idea of where we want to go.</p>
<p>Here is a simple exercise we can all do. Imagine that our thoughts had 100% power to manifest themselves. Suppose that whatever we wanted, we would get. If we wanted to be perfectly forgiving whatever other people did, we could become that. If we wanted to be happy whatever our outer circumstances, we could have that. For the moment, leave aside whether it&#8217;s feasible. Just feel anything is possible and imagine yourself as you really want to be. There are no limits, if you want to have a deep and abiding sense of peace all the time, why not choose that?</p>
<h3>Factors that can help us in knowing what we want to be.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Appreciate good qualities in others. It is good to be inspired by the positive qualities of other people. This is not imitation. This is seeing good qualities and feeling that they can become part of ourself. If someone else can be resolutely cheerful, we can make this part of ourself. <span id="more-954"></span></li>
<li>When you were really happy, how did you feel? It is important to remember times when we were sincerely happy or sincerely at peace. What enabled us to do that? When we are in a good frame of mind, we are invariably  friendly, kind and compassionate &#8211; all qualities we like to see in ourself.  If you have ever had a powerful meditation, imagine you could have that consciousness all the time.</li>
<li>Be wary of the ego. When we visualise who we want to be, we need to be careful we don&#8217;t allow the ego to colour our good intentions. The egos priorities are usually to be seen as a great and good person. The ego colours our good motivations with the need for praise. The ego can be very clever and turn good qualities into a subtle desire for name and fame. But, remember we can visualise how we really want to be. Therefore, in our perfect visualisation, we can be free of the egos demands. We can enjoy the freedom of not needing outer praise. We can visualise ourself as inwardly happy, regardless of whether the ego is praised or blamed.</li>
<li>Wisdom. We can read through the great spiritual books that inspire us the most. The philosophy that springs out, we should make a note of. We should never think spiritual philosophy is only for saints. If we want we can make it part of our life.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The importance of knowing who we want to be</h3>
<ul>
<li>Overcoming self-doubt. The biggest thing holding us back is our self-doubt. Perhaps we feel these good qualities are not meant for us. Perhaps we feel, it&#8217;s our lot to be unhappy and face difficult circumstances. Having the faith to visualise ourselves as we could be, helps us to break this self-doubt.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When self-doubt<br />
Departs<br />
God-Peace Arrives.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<ul>
<li>If we know what we want to be, we can make it a reality. If we know we need to pass an exam, we will spend several years studying and revising. But, if there is no test, nothing to aim for, our studies will drift and we will never make satisfactory progress. Just reminding ourselves of what we want to be, will give us the motivation and encouragement to focus on these aims. If we want to simplify our life and have a feeling of inner freedom, reminding ourselves of this will help to prevent us adding unnecessary complications and stress to our lives.</li>
<li>Imagination has a power of its own. We started the exercise by saying that imagine thoughts have 100% power to manifest. If we think ill of ourselves, that would be our reality, if we think ourselves as cheerful and self-giving &#8211; that is what we can become. However, this isn&#8217;t just an exercise. Our primary thoughts and underlying opinion of ourselves do have tremendous power. Thoughts may not manifest immediately, but they do have a strong influence on what we become. If we always hold onto this ideal of what we want to become, then it will help this aspiration to become a reality.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can we learn to do the right thing? Quite often we know what the right thing is to do, but some force of habit holds us back. Perhaps we know what the right thing is, but we fear what people may say or we worry that it will be misunderstood. Other times, it is our own pride or insecurity which prevents us from doing the right thing.  If we need more motivation and strength to do the right thing, there are a few things we can bear in mind.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928" title="river" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/river.jpg" alt="river" width="500" height="399" /></p>
<p><strong>Joy from doing the right thing</strong></p>
<p>The most effective way to do the right thing is to bear in mind the joy we can get from doing the right thing. If we don&#8217;t follow our heart, there will always be some mental tension, some feeling of looking over our shoulder. But, if we do the right thing, we will get that precious joy that we are following the right road and being true to ourselves. As the immortal Shakespeare writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This above all: to thine own self be true,<br />
And it must follow, as the night the day,<br />
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br />
Farewell, my blessing season this in thee!</p>
<p>&#8211; Hamlet, Act 1</p>
<p>This captures the poetic beauty of living true to ourselves. Even if temporarily difficult, this inner peace from our decision is very valuable. Bear in mind, that the inner peace and inner joy is the most valuable thing on earth, it is not something that can be bought.</p>
<p><span id="more-927"></span></p>
<p><strong>Truth Prevails</strong></p>
<p>Those who prosper by deception or falsehood, never last the course. There is a saying in the Upanishads &#8216;Truth Prevails&#8217; &#8211; this is very true &#8211; even if sometimes, it takes longer than we might expect. But, ff we always remember the power of truth, we will be inspired to live according to these principles and not seek for false happiness through a mischievous way of being.</p>
<p><strong>What is pride?</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest failings of humans is to stick to the wrong course of action because we feel it hurts our pride to change course. We think people will think us foolish or weak if we admit mistakes or change the course of action. However, this is mistaken, have you ever felt worse of someone who stopped doing the wrong thing and chose instead the correct thing? No. We always admire people who can learn from their mistakes and listen to advice. If people can change their actions, we admire that. Never feel we must continue doing the wrong thing, just because it looks &#8216;strong&#8217;. It is always worth changing, no matter how we might worry what it looks like. The best time to do the right thing is now.</p>
<p><strong>Listen</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, we instinctively know the right thing to do, but on other occasions we can have conflicting voices in our mind telling us what to do. In this case, we can try meditating on the problem. Just try to clear your mind, let go of any thoughts and see whether in the still mind, it becomes clearer as to the correct course of action. Sometimes, even sleeping on a problem can help a little bit. In the morning, when we first wake up, there is time for us to mull on the decision. Somehow in sleep we can give our conscience time to awaken. Sri Chinmoy also suggests just sitting quietly and listening to the voice of conscience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;In the spiritual life also your conscience will tell you what to do and what not to do. But in order to use your conscience as a guide, you have to be very careful. You have to remain calm and quiet; otherwise, your vital being will imitate the voice of your conscience and confuse you. It will make you feel that what you are doing is right, even though it is wrong. You don&#8217;t have to learn how to meditate in order to be calm and quiet for a few minutes. Many times when you are tired and exhausted, you just sit quietly. So you <em>can</em> sit quietly, and when you do, you will hear the voice of your conscience. It will say either &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; Only two words it has: &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no.&#8221; You want to do something and if it says &#8220;yes,&#8221; then you can do it. If it says &#8220;no&#8221;, then never do it. You should not argue with your conscience; only you should listen to its voice.&#8221;  [1]</p>
<p><strong>What motivates the choice?</strong></p>
<p>Often we do the wrong thing because we are seeking to please our ego. We do something to impress others, to gain from others or  simply to boost our ego. However, when we act out of motives of self-aggrandisement, we are prone to doing the wrong thing, and, at best, it will give us a false happiness. If we act with more honourable motives, it will be much easier to do the right thing. If we simply seek to treat others as we would want to be treated, we will act with kindness and concern towards others. If we have a self-giving attitude, then we will be protected from making selfish choices which we regret later. If we seek to act with humility and honesty, then the actual choices we make become less important; people will, over time, appreciate the motives behind our actions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is said that the love of money is the root of all evil, but money is also an inescapable reality of life. Money can definitely create tension, worry, and put even the best friendships under strain. But, money is essential component of life, and if used properly it can be a force for good and contribute towards our happiness.<br />

<h4>How can we learn to have a good attitude to money?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Money is a means to an end. It can be used for good purposes or it can be put to bad purposes. In this sense money is neutral – it is up to us to use it in a divine way and not misuse it.</li>
<li>If money is used in an appropriate way, it can contribute to our happiness. However, the unbridled pursuit of money will definitely cause us lose sight of the most valuable aspects of life &#8211; such as, cultivating inner peace and good relationships with others.</li>
<li>If we sacrifice our principles and sense of value, what is the use of money? We have to remember what gives us a true sense of happiness. The real happiness comes from being true to our self, to be self-giving and offer happiness to others. If we have to betray these ideals to gain money, then at best the money will buy us a false happiness.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry! Money is probably the biggest cause of worry in modern life. Often it is the richest people who worry the most. The more we gain, the more we stand to lose. Learn to let go of worry &#8211; worry doesn&#8217;t help in anyway only makes us more tense. If you have real difficulties, just see what practical steps you can take. If you have a reasonably good financial situation, just enjoy it! <span id="more-914"></span></li>
<li>Don’t feel guilt for earning money. Money is not in essence a bad thing. Some people go to the other extreme of being careless or even rejecting flows of money. They may subconsciously feel they don’t deserve it or always expect to be poor. If we expect to be poor and feel sorry for ourselves, it is quite likely to occur.</li>
<li>A healthy approach to money is to see it as a flow. We receive money for our work, and then can share that with others by buying goods. Money is not a thing to be hoarded, but by spending on things we need, we can allow a healthy flow and sharing. Sometimes, we buy goods we don&#8217;t need, but sometimes we also miss out on important activities because we are worried about the cost. You will rarely get to the end of your life and regret spending money on worthwhile pursuits. Be willing to spend money on good things.</li>
<li>Don’t resent paying money. You can be a multi-millionaire, but still resent paying 50p for parking your car. It is good to feel joy in spending money; it helps you appreciate what you get. Rather than resenting paying 50p for car parking – feel how you are contributing to a vital facility. Why should everything be free?</li>
<li>It is common to resent paying taxes, but even with taxes we can see it as a way to fund important public services. By paying tax we can feel we are contributing towards society. We will have to pay our taxes whatever, but we can always change our attitude to paying tax &#8211; we can do it with a feeling of reluctance or we can do it cheerfully.</li>
<li>Money teaches us the value of goods.  If everything came free, without any effort &#8211; we would not gain the satisfaction of working hard. We have to learn how to put value on things. Many instant lottery millionaires &#8211; end up going back to work at some point. They miss the challenge and test of working for a living.</li>
<li>Giving money with a good motive. Some people love to give money and help others. But, you have to be careful with your motives. If you have a lot of money which you freely spend and give away, there is a danger of becoming proud and gaining a subtle feeling that if you give money, you earn the right to influence the other person. If you are very free with money, there is also a danger of attracting the wrong kinds of friends. There is good advice in the Bible <em>&#8220;But when you give to someone in need, don&#8217;t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing&#8221;.</em> It is good to give,  but much more important to give with humility and unconditionally.</li>
<li>As well as receiving with good graces, there are also times when we need to be comfortable receiving. We shouldn&#8217;t expect to always be self-sufficient. It can be an important life lesson to accept others help with good grace.</li>
<li>Work v Leisure. Sometimes, our whole life can become dedicated around earning money. The pursuit of career and money becomes a surrogate for other more important objectives and values. If we feel our life is losing balance, keep reminding yourself of the motto &#8211; &#8216;live for the present moment&#8217;. The aim of life is not to have a big pension pot in 40 years time.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I love the present moment,<br />
Now,<br />
More than I love<br />
Anything.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How To Deal With Friends and their approach to Money</h4>
<ul>
<li>You need to be tolerant of friends different attitudes to money. But, at the same time, you may need to be firm and clear. This article was partly inspired by relationships with other people and the whole range of attitudes people have to money. One thing I notice is that people often seem to end up repeating certain habits and patterns with regard to money. Some are frequently in the position of needing to borrow from other people.  I often find myself surrounded with friends who are really great, but have  poor money management! I do believe in karma, so this is my money karma. The most important thing is whether you can be</li>
<li>If you lend money to friends, you have to be very careful. The most important thing is that you have to be happy with the situation. If you give out of a sense of duty, but secretly resent it, it would be better not to get involved. Because sometime later, this resentment may come back and damage the relationship.  Here good communication is important. Offer practical suggestions for overcoming financial difficulties. If loans are helpful make sure it is tied to some tangible action. I can&#8217;t say whether it is good to lend to friends or not. You have to be the judge of who you are dealing with. Generally, if you can avoid lending and borrowing, that is good.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/thchopst.jpg" alt="difficult people" /></p>
<p>Life will always present us with awkward, difficult people; and unless you want to live in a Himalayan cave you will have to learn how to deal with these people. We should not let difficult people spoil our inner equanimity; with the right attitude we can maintain our peace of mind even when dealing with unpleasant people. These are some suggestions for dealing with awkward people.</p>
<p><strong>1. Don&#8217;t Think about Them All the Time</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes when people cause us difficulties they start to dominate our thoughts; this makes their presence seem very close. However, it is best to think about them as little as possible. Instead, concentrate on things and people who inspire you. Thinking about difficult people is not going to change how they behave, but it will cause us unhappiness.</p>
<p><strong>2. Don&#8217;t Expect to Change Them.</strong></p>
<p>Awkward and unpleasant people are the least likely to be willing to change themselves. Don&#8217;t take it upon yourself to try and change their behaviour; you will all most certainly fail. Furthermore, they will probably resent your interference and this will create further difficulties. Instead we can maintain a cheerful detachment. If we don&#8217;t have any expectations, it becomes much easier to deal with.</p>
<p><strong>3. Don&#8217;t feel guilt</strong></p>
<p>If people create problems in our life we can start to feel guilty, even though we have done nothing wrong. In cases like this<br />
we have to be detached; it is not our fault problems are created. As long as we seek to maintain a good attitude, that is all that matters.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you want to transform your life<br />
Radically,<br />
Then immediately give up<br />
Your false sense of teeming guilt.</p>
<div id="bookexcerpt">Sri Chinmoy [1]</div>
<p><span id="more-67"></span></p>
<p><strong>4. Silence is a powerful weapon.</strong></p>
<p>When people say unreasonable things, the natural instinct is to try and argue with them. However, this draws us into their weird perspective. In many circumstances, it may be appropriate to maintain silence and not respond to what they say and do. By being silent, we are effectively ignoring them without having to criticise their actions. In silence their is great power; when we ignore them, they lose influence. Silence also gives us time to think a more measured and detached response, for later.</p>
<p><strong>5. Retain your Humour.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t feel obliged to take every situation seriously. Try to see the funny side. If people behave in a ridiculous way, don&#8217;t despair &#8211; just see the absurd behaviour as a humorous situation. The comical aspect of the TV programme, The Office came simply from ordinary people behaving in unreasonable ways.</p>
<p><strong>6. Don&#8217;t seek to Avoid them</strong></p>
<p>If you have to work with a difficult people, the solution is rarely to move job. The likelihood is that you will find difficult people wherever you work. If you try to avoid difficult people, you will be permanently on the move. The thing to do is to change your attitude; rather than feeling depressed and guilty, we can see it is an opportunity for our self improvement. Through learning to deal with difficulty people, we will learn many valuable life skills.</p>
<p><strong>6. Offer Goodwill.</strong></p>
<p>If we can offer goodwill even to difficult people, we will make tremendous progress. Unpleasant people may deserve criticism, but, this will not help the situation. Even the most difficult person may have one or two good qualities. Try to mentions these; subconsciously they will appreciate our goodwill. This remains the most effective way to bring out the best in others &#8211; even if it may seem to take a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>7. Don&#8217;t Try to Impress or Gain favour</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, whatever we do, people will look at the negative side and criticise us. This can cause us to seek even harder to seek their approval. But, this can cause us to ignore our basic values, and sometimes even if we change, we still don&#8217;t gain their approval anyway. There is much more dignity in being true to ourselves, and being happy with our choices. If some difficult people don&#8217;t appreciate our actions, no harm. We can never expect to receive everyone&#8217;s approval.</p>
