		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I enjoyed reading this. It made me think about how we are connected to the world. I strive to be independant, but maybe that is the wrong goal. Instead my focus should be on developing relationships. Constructive relationships that have mutual benefits, in other words make more friends.
But I have to admit this is a scarey thought for me, because my natural tendancy is to do things on my own. Articles like yours are making me more aware of my mistake, and the need to face my fear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi.

I came to your blogsite today after typing &quot;difficulty controlling thought processes&quot; into the Google search engine.  I find it something serendipitous that I found this site as it was just what I needed.  The tips on meditation are very useful for me as I am at a difficult point in my life and I am desperate for an inner peace.

I come here somewhat familiar with aspects of Buddhism, particularly Zen.  I study many things, I know many things; yet I am deeply troubled and seek a peace I have not yet been able to identify.

This article on the television program (and you reflections upon this) was very interesting.

I recently bought a nice little Christian keepsake for a friend - she is a Christian.  It was a small paper image (perhaps - an icon) of St. Francis preaching, as it happens, to birds in a tree.  I was so enchanted with it - I bought one for myself.  On the back of this printed card is a&quot;A Prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi&quot; and I thought I would share it with you.

&quot;Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace.
Where there is hatred, let me sow love,
Where there is injury, pardon,
Where there is doubt, faith,
Where there is despair, hope,
Where there is darkness, light, and where there is sadness, joy.
O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled, as to console;
To be understood, as to understand;
To be loved, as to love;
For it is in giving that we receive --
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned;
And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.&quot;

There is something deeply touching in the humility and love of the sentiment here.

Peace,
G.]]></description>
