		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Keith for thoughtful article.

I think a life of simplicity doesn&#039;t have to be boring, far from it. I get bored when stuck in a rut. I think part of it is not explaining to other people but concentrating on living a full life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this is a good article. It highlights that what you own also owns you. We can so easily be caught up in the endless round of attachment and resistance. A really good point brought out in the article is the danger of becoming attached to the idea of simplicity; i.e. to strive for simplicity, and of course this is not simplicity but just another ambition to acquire something, cherish it and to resist losing it. The point is to just see the mess you are in as a mess; the wisdom that comes from seeing that brings about its own simplicity without your striving. I think the difficult thing is that you have to live alongside others who don&#039;t see things this way. How do you cope with the fact that they see you now as unambitious and boring?]]></description>
