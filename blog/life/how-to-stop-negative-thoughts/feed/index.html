		<description><![CDATA[Zoe,

This is the book I read to learn about meditation as a beginner:

&#039;Turning the Mind Into an Ally&#039; by Sakyong Mipham 

It&#039;s excellent.  A lot of people recommend &#039;Zen Mind, Beginner&#039;s Mind&#039;, but I found that a little less user-friendly.  Maybe I would feel differently about it now, I don&#039;t know.

Another all-time favorite is by the father of Sakyong Mipham, Chogyam Trungpa:

&#039;Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior&#039;   

Indispensable.

Best of luck on your journey :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a very relevant post - I really believe that people don&#039;t often realize how many negative thoughts they carry inside, until they truly start listening to themselves.  When I made up my mind to become improve my outlook on life (3 years ago), I started becoming aware of how much negativity I carried with me. In the last few years, I&#039;ve learned to stop the negative tape and replace it with positivity, and with that, serenity.  (at least most of the time!) I sleep better, I&#039;m much happier, and life feels good.]]></description>
