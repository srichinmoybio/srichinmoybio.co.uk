		<description><![CDATA[That was a very good clear comment on what leadership is especially on the point that says, 
&quot;A lot of tension in leadership situations comes because we have a fixed idea of what should happen, regardless of peoples’ abilities to carry that thing out&quot;.

I personally believe leaders are born different and will never perform the same. People have different strengths and in different ways.

I really liked your peace of work would be greatfull to keep receiving that on the mail provided above.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.&quot;

This is a great quote, another I like is &quot;A leader is a visionary teacher of dreaming&quot;

Repetition is the key to shared vision, “if you say it 100 times it becomes a fact” – people will pick up on things you repeat, so if you repeat your vision, it will become everyone’s vision]]></description>
