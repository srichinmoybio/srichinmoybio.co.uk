		<description><![CDATA[Good work on the goodness!  This is a quality of my spiritual name, and there are many subtle unknowns therein always waiting to be explored.  The thing about not wanting to create drama, and the value of little things especially resonates.  How to have goodness, and at the some time wisdom in action is the challenge.   Our teacher always referred to&quot; good Canada&#039;s oneness-heart. &quot;   Really the same idea as becoming the tree instead of just climbing it.  (I&#039;m a Canadian.)  Brain lag is setting in.  The thought train is slowing.  Another day  it will gather steam.  Thanks!

		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful post. I would say people confuse goodness with the polarities of good &amp; bad. Goodness goes much deeper than that. Indeed, badness/evil could be said to be the absence of goodness rather than its opposite, like darkness is the absence of light. As you observe, goodness arises as an inherent part of the human condition because it is the nature of what is. The very nature of existence can be said to arise in an outflow of goodness.]]></description>
