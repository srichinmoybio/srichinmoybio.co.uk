		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t watched the news in years - we actually got rid of cable altogether a few years back, and prior to that were using Tivo to only record the shows we wanted to watch.

A lot of people question whether or not I can be up on &quot;current events&quot; if I don&#039;t read the news online, no paper, and don&#039;t watch it.

I just reply:

&quot;If it&#039;s important enough for me to know about, then I&#039;ll find out somehow.&quot;

That seems to be true.  And I&#039;m grateful that I don&#039;t have my head in the trenches everyday with people talking about the &quot;doom and gloom.&quot;

People could learn a lot by just watching Finding Nemo when Ellen Degeneres&#039; character says:

&quot;Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming.&quot;]]></description>
