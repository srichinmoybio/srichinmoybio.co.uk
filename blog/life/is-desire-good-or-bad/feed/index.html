		<description><![CDATA[...Seems to me that there is a general feeling that desire is undesirable... or rather, that a &#039;state of non-desiring&#039; is a very desirable thing indeed... I can&#039;t wait for it! I want it so badly, that I&#039;m doing everything Sri Chimnoy talks about - so I hope it comes soon...!  Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Tejvan, This was very helpful. I have been struggling with these issues most of my adult life. I have been well employed and been able to acquire many things. Now that I am feeling a level of understanding that was lacking in the past, I am wanting to share those insights with others. I have been wondering if this is just another ego desire. When you made the distinction clear that a person can have an &quot;aspiration&quot; that comes from the heart instead of the ego it settled my mind. Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tejvan, thanks for the very insightful post :) I think an experience of both is essential for someone to truly appreciate the value of pursuing their aspirations. Someone who has pursued and experienced his/her desires before will be able to know that it is something hollow; it is only a mean and not an end in itself.]]></description>
