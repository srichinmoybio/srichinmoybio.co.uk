		<description><![CDATA[I find myself wallowing in self-pity and wow ur right. I do it because someone has wronged me and I want them to feel guilty so they won&#039;t do it again. It hasn&#039;t worked and Im only hurting myself. Self pity is a pathetic characteristic that only weakens our souls and strengthens those that hurt us.  I feel as though I have given up but I guess a part of me still fights or I wouldnt be reading and responding to thus article. Thank you for you input, it is greatly appreciated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best way to stop feeling sorry for yourself and stop negativity is to pray consistently for the Lord&#039;s help and be determined to stop it.  It takes time and patience and is very frustrating.  But the rewards can be great.  If you&#039;re truly focused on changing it, and you seek God&#039;s help, it will change.  

I&#039;m speaking from experience as I&#039;ve lived over 45 years in negativity, self-pity, low self-esteem/self-worth, self-centered.  And it&#039;s been slowly changing these last couple of year&#039;s with God&#039;s help.]]></description>

Console one’s mind.
Self-pity cannot
Strengthen one’s heart.
Self-pity only makes one
A real stranger to oneself.
