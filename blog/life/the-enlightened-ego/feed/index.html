		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Chris - our ego is a necessary and helpful part of us.  Without ego and mind, it would be very difficult for us to function here in the physical world.

The ego is a wonderful tool.  The problem is that for many, it has become the master.  Our work really is to allow our Higher Self, our spirit, to become the master once again.

Blessings,
Andrea]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have found that partnering with the ego can be much more helpful in moving towards that peaceful place than trying to eradicate it entirely.

There&#039;s a lot of reasons for this, but the most fundamental is that we have to understand, accept, and ultimately know that our ego truly does what it thinks is best for us... it acts out of love (even if it doesn&#039;t always &#039;sound&#039; loving)

I talk a lot about this in a recent audio interview with regards to working with our &quot;inner critic&quot;:
