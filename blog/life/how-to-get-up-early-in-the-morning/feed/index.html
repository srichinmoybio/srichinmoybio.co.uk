		<description><![CDATA[The will to get up ealy is the key. Will has to be very very strong. Ask yourself, do you really love your morning 2 hours sleep better than hurting your self esteem by 1) Not keeping up your promise of getting early that you made to yourself 2) Feeling ashamed to reach office late (although nobody shouts at you) 3) Are your career goals are valuable enough than that stupid sleep of 6 to 8 in the morning! Hate yourself if you cant get up..!!!]]></description>
