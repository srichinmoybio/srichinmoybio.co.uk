		<description><![CDATA[Loved this article.  At 43 years old i am starting a journey of deep reflection and self-discovery.  For most of my life i have let religious dogmas and criticism effect my true hearts calling.  Through so called &quot;guidance&quot; I received from the &quot;church&quot; - I was led to believe alternative healing, eg yoga, meditation and like interests were &quot;evil&quot; and full of mysticism and basically unsafe areas to persue. It has taken me alot of, almost, mental suffering, to leave this way of thinking and discover new ways of &quot;being&quot;.  I believe like you say, &quot;Each one of us has an absolutely unique purpose – something which they can offer to the world in a way that no-one else can.&quot;
Thankyou for this wonderful article and truly inspiring web-site.
Namaste&#039;

		<description><![CDATA[I am way big into self-improvement and self-discovery, hoping to make myself a better person and therefore be a better parent to my 2 kids.
