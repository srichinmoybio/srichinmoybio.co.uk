		<description><![CDATA[&quot;We rarely regret being kind and sympathetic to others.&quot;

One might even go as far as to say, if we&#039;re in a state of gratitude we never regret being kind and sympathetic to others... since the regret requires us to have an attachment to the outcome.  

This reminds me of the story on my website &quot;The Giver Should be Thankful&quot;.

Easier said than done, though.  It&#039;s so often to just be thankful when somebody does something for us... but how often are we just in a state of thanks regardless of our environment and experiences?

Honestly speaking, I&#039;ve felt that only a handful of times.  And that handful of times are some of the most memorable... simple... but memorable.]]></description>
