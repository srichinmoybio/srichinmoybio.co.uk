		<description><![CDATA[Wonderful article!

I adore children. Sometimes I feel like I don&#039;t want to grow up I want to stay child like Peter Pan but the truth is no one could stop growing up. So I chose to spend more time with children.  

Thanks :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved your article! (: I&#039;m glad I stumbled upon it. It brought me back to a time when I had a strong sense of appreciation for every new sound, smell, taste, and touch I encountered as a child. 

As a child I thought the elevators had magical powers, because each time they opened I&#039;d see different hallways &amp; different people coming in &amp; out. 


Also, when I used to live in an environment w/ much poverty, my friends &amp; I would visit the local garbage dump, &amp; we were amazed of the wonderful toys &amp; stuff we&#039;d find. We didn&#039;t worry so much about getting ourselves dirty. 


(: Thanks again !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shane,

Well I could talk about more stories with my son, but that would take forever!  Especially the ones that involve momentary bursts of profanity. ;)

He got my deviousness, my wife&#039;s persistence, and the curiosity that we both share.  The result is a kid who is tons of &quot;trouble&quot; and more full of life than anybody I&#039;ve ever met.

I will be curious (read: possibly frightened) to see what his first clearly audible word will be...]]></description>

David, Andrea and Chris...I love hearing people talking about children, and children stories in general. Keep them coming!

Snehashila - I think it is because you are also a child at heart that you could appreciate this :)]]></description>
