		<description><![CDATA[That article was really an awesome work. Great read !But there is something more that I want the readers to express there views upon. Most often the difficult people that we try to love become fed up of us(just because we are trying to love someone as typical as them) and try their level best to detach themselves from us. Such people feel that we should leave them for their happiness. The most difficult people I have found are loners, they want to be alone but at the same time want to be in love wth someone. But, their basic selves keep them pulling back to be what they are---------&#039;loners&#039;. How can we tackle such cases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank You! I really enjoyed this post.  This makes total sense to me.  I&#039;ve been on the path of personnal developement for some time now, and have come to realize that making change a requirement before we can love somebody is trap that leads to un-happiness.  One thing that I&#039;ve learned to do is to make a list of everything that I love about that person, then build the relationship on those strengths.  Thanks!!]]></description>
