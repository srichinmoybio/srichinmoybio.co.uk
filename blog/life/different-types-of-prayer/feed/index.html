		<description><![CDATA[What I&#039;ve come to realise, especially in recent time, is that I don&#039;t actually want anything. When asking for things which are given to me externally, I find that it&#039;s wrong, unfair and unjust - why should I deserve a wish when others could have one. Moreover I&#039;ve grown to welcome the ideas of rugged individualism in a sense of the personal mind - why run of supernatural steam, it&#039;s not yours.

Praying, I find, is a beautifully crafted way of readying yourself. You may take it as asking, but if considered correctly - when praying and asking for something, you&#039;re consciously voicing your concerns - something you might otherwise not do. Once you accept a problem or desire, it becomes significantly easier to tackle it.]]></description>
