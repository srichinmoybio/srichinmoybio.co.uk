		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Maria. It is always a great feeling to know that someone is inspired, it helps to inspire us even more....

As regards the last line, it might be a slight exaggeration to call this blog a collection of &#039;my&#039; teachings or Tejvan&#039;s teachings. We have both been very fortunate to come into contact through meditation with a wisdom that has been around for thousands of years, a wisdom which many great teachers from all cultural and spiritual backgrounds have talked about.  Our only wish with this blog is to take some of this wisdom and share it with people, and hopefully they can use it to help them on their own inner journey. Thanks again for the nice comment!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this topic because we are always trying to find things or reasons why we aren&#039;t doing the things that will help better us in life, I have to also agree with Chris when he wrote:

* Any beliefs I have that others hold me back was only my own insecurities, my own mind, trying to disempower me from going outside of my comfort zone.

That was enough said.. we do get caught up in our comfort zone and a lot of times it&#039;s easier for most people to give up then to continue to try hard to succeed,  I once was listening to an insprational tape where Anthony Robbins stated: it&#039;s crowded at the bottom, but it&#039;s a whole lot of room at the top.. in other words he was saying it&#039;s so easy to give up and that&#039;s what a lot of people do but when you try really hard to achieve something worthwhile and make it there is a lot of room at the top where you can be successful and truly live your dreams , I have really been learning a lot in reading these articles and again feel so blessed and fortunate to have come across this site, I know personally that after reading all of this I will definitely take something positive away from what has been written and hold on to it and know the way I have always felt and been on the inside does have a lot of meaning and purpose and now I have something to go by that can help me be that true inspirational human being that God has always intended for me to be.

Again much respect, blessings and continued success in your teachings and writing.. : 0 )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel the last line of this is the most powerful... I&#039;d even separate it into a new paragraph if I were writing this post:

&quot;And remember, at the end of the day the only voice you are in any way beholden to is the voice of your own soul.&quot;

I have learned over time, and in some ways am still learning, that there is nobody else who holds me back.  The only person who holds me back is me.

Any beliefs I have that others hold me back was only my own insecurities, my own mind, trying to disempower me from going outside of my comfort zone.

Many of us have heard the saying, &quot;Nobody can make you do something that you don&#039;t want to do.&quot;  The same is true in this case.  Nobody can hold us back unless some part of us wants to be held back...

So my suggestion is that anytime somebody believes that he/she is being held back, that person should really spend times asking themselves what the real reason is that they don&#039;t move forward.]]></description>
