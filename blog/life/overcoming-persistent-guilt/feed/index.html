When we feel guilty, we feel unhappy and it is like placing a large stone around our neck. If we avoid feelings of guilt, it is much easier to take a positive and constructive approach. If we can remain happy and detached, then we will have the inspiration to make a better effort. But, if we react to criticism with guilt and misery, it will compound any problem.

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Guilt can be a weight around our neck, which does nothing to help us. The great spiritual master, Sri Ramakrishna said something most significant. He said &#8220;the person who goes around saying &#8216;I am a sinner, I am a sinner&#8217; - this person will remain a sinner.&#8221; But, why maintain this attitude? Rather than focusing on our past &#8217;sins&#8217; we have to feel that this is not our real self. If we have the capacity to &#8217;sin&#8217; we also have the capacity to do the right thing and lead a good life. It is focusing on good things that will make us a better person. Focusing on our past mistakes will just lower our consciousness not make us feel any better. See also: Overcoming persistent guilt [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On a related note, I used to punish myself whenever I felt guilty for doing or not doing something.  Nowadays I choose the opposite and do things that feed my soul. 

Guilt is punishment enough, why do I need to further drain my resources to move on by punishing myself?  Time for rest and reward is not just for achievements and celebrations.  Actually, you need to treat yourself even nicer than usual, precisely when you make a mistake or experience a failure.
