		<description><![CDATA[Indian Vedantic texts like UPANISADS are devoted to the unravelling of the ULTIMATE TRUTH  about the universe - but all this search finally ends up in &quot;I&quot;. 

There is no Universe - when there is no &quot;I&quot;.  This I is different from the ego-centric &quot;I&quot;, which we generally understand. All of our sense organs and the mind, which are our only instruments to understand the universe and our self - are all directed outward. That is the problem. 

The Universe can never be understood in its totality with this outward bound search. We can not understand even one sub atomic particle in its totality this way. So trying to understand the universe is a totally fruitless and pointless search. That recognition drove the great sages into an inward search - which proved eminently successful.All truth is hidden within us. You don&#039;t need to search any where else. Ramana Maharshi is incomparable in his clarity of &quot;I&quot;.

Eckhart Tolle comes close in dealing with his POWER OF NOW. When the past and future are abolished from the mind, the present moment only remains. In the present, all sorrows,worries, angers and jealousies disappear. You begin to enjoy life from a new angle. But, that is the starting point of the &quot;I&quot; search. Not its end. Meditation precisely accomplishes this goal - of living in the present.

When the I is discovered / uncovered - the past, the present and the future merge seamlessly. You discover your immortal nature.

This EGOLESS &quot;I&quot; is called &quot;SAT-CHIT-ANANDA&quot; -  meaning the eternal - consciousness - bliss principle. There is nothing more and nothing less in this Universe - this is what we discover in the &quot;I&quot;.

The EGO belongs to the body, the mind and the senses  and is subject to birth and death along with them -  where as the EGOLESS &quot;I&quot;  is SAT-CHIT-ANANDA, which is immortal. 

The central point here is - this must not be understood in mere logical way - but in a complete, experiential way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The answer to &quot;why am I&quot; is very simple. Because you were BORN. 
In fact if you look at all questions apart from who am I the answers can always be reduced to one of 2 answers. Either because &quot;you where born&quot; or because &quot;you will Die&quot;
Once you have grasped this the only true question is &quot;who am I&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is true that once we start looking for answer to this question - Who Am I ? - all our other questions disappear or look insignificant. With this drops all our outside anxities, worries and problems.

If anybody wants to learn more on how to go deep into this question and find its answer he/she can write me at kad.vinod@gmail.com. 

I will be very happy to help everybody on this path.]]></description>
