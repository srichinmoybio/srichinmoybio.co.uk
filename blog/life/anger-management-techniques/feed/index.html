		<description><![CDATA[Hello:
I would like to suggest, for any child who has a lot of expression of anger/frustration
towards parents or others, 
that perhaps some space is needed - the feeling of space in the mind, that it is
possible to communicate.
to understand that it is quite common for people not to understand what you
are communicating right away - but to learn methods for expanding on your
communicating.
that as you work more with this, then it starts to become easier.

Often it is because we do not feel understood.   Then it is possible to think
of different ways to express what you are saying, to make it clearer to the parent.

Also, to understand that parents will not always understand us.  There is always
another opportunity.  To feel positive that this can happen.
That parents may sometimes understand and hear us, however, they still
may not agree to &#039;give&#039; us what we &#039;want&#039;.  

As a caveat, I wish to say that any child who is in an abusive or unsafe
environment, should contact a person whom they trust - at school or elsewhere safe,
and should work persistently, and calmly toward - being protected and taken care of.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really loving this site. I have a lot of pent up anger because my last two relationships were with drug addicts and alcoholics which has caused me to become a co-dependent and very resentful and untrusting.  After reading the articles on anger and self-esteem on this site, I feel a shift has taken place and accountability for my own actions has been admitted. I did the best with what I knew at the time.  And here we are.  I can see now that all that has happened in my life has led me to this point in my life where I am able to start all over and see that it&#039;s not as bad as it used to be.  I have come a long way and have so much more hope then ever that life can only get better because of sites like this that inspire me to take positive steps in co-creating my best life. Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My husband gets so angry at me. We go about 6 months pretty good and then I do something that upsets him and all hell breaks loose. And I have to hear how I did it on purpose, I live to upset him. He was really miserable the last 6 months. He was just fakiing it. And anything else he can say to hurt me. You can not reason with him in any way. Then he leaves me for days or weeks. This has been going on for 27 years. And before I make him mad, he seems happy with our lives. He always tells me he loves me. We have 3 children together. And have a lot of hobbies in common. I just don&#039;t know what to do anymore. Can anyone really change? He usually gets mad because I don&#039;t agree with him on something, or complain about something especially if i express he did it wrong. and then i try to have a conversation about it  trying to explain i don&#039;t blame him just that we see somethings different.I believe he feels like he fails me and covers that up by blaming me and getting angry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@AbssM    It won&#039;t be easy to deal with an unknown anger. On the one hand it will make you insane, on the other hand it will give you self-pity. Our brains play a big role and responsible in responding to our emotions. In your case, anger. Your 15yo sister is not a favorite of your parents. Your parents care for you, and they got worried when you hid yourself in the backyard. How did I arrived with all these fancy ideas? Well, it is because these are all positive situations, once you manage to think positively, negative emotions will eventually disappear. Everything happens with the way we think about the situation. Happiness is but in the state of our minds. Otherwise, we will feel miserable. And other people may not even aware that we are miserable. If we can give ourselves the chance &quot;the-feeling-of-forever&quot; to hate everything about our life, why not try to give at least just 60seconds to think about good things that can make you happy. Feel the difference. And indulge with the emotion you choose and like to deal with for the rest of your life. It&#039;s your choice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If anger is not shown to others, then they will take the situation very lightly and forget it in the future as a result they will do the same mistake again and again.

for ex: i made a sudden plan of going out for a tour but my friend after telling yes to give me company, suddenly refuses to come with me. This makes the situation very tense and make me angry.
it is possible to control your anger 1ce but its impossible to control next time if you are a short tempered. Its very impossible to show whats going inside...................................]]></description>
