		<description><![CDATA[I worked in retail customer service for a number of years and angry customers was the norm in a days work.

The most important thing to remember is that you can be totally unaffected by someone elses anger. You can be totally happy, content and at peace while being yelled at.

It took me quite a few years to figure that out.

Once you can remain detached, then you can deal with the problem in the best way. Making the best use of the good suggestions made in this post.

Nice!]]></description>
