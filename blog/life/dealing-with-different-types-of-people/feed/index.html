		<description><![CDATA[I discovered this article because I was researching how to respond to someone with a differing point of view to mine, and I found this article very informative so I believe in giving credit where credit is due.. We have all dealt with difficult people. I have some family members that continually inflate their own egos at the expense of my own,  and it does become boring, frustrating  and tedious to listen to on a weekly basis.  I do not agree that we only notice these qualities in others because we possess them ourselves... If this is the case, then because I witnessed  and I admit I subjectively judged the foul-mouthed &#039;father&#039; at the supermarket today, who was screaming obscenities at his young crying child, a &#039;scumbag&#039;, does that make me one as well???.  I am not one to inflate my own ego, but I certainly would never treat another human being that way, let alone a poor defenseless young child; it was sad to watch. In sum, we are all entitled to our own opinions... and unless you can back up your opinion with fact, then it remains a subjective belief. When it comes to dealing with difficult people, it is helpful to learn what is fixable, what you&#039;re prepared to tolerate, and what to walk away from.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This article was good, I wish there were helpful ways on dealing with these people. I know someone that is very opinionated and it is directed at me and what is going on in my life and by the end of our discussions I feel hurt by the stuff said to me. I need to learn how to not be so effected by what she says to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this is a great article and very accurate to personality types. I don&#039;t understand. Simona Rich comments as these personality types exist so we can&#039;t ignore, but we do need advice on how to deal with them. Working with a very opinionated person is very difficult, even if you empathise and understand where it might be coming from, their behavoiur is wearing and  hard to cope with day in day out.  I work with someone who constantly  praising herself and puts me down at every opportunity, she is sarcastic and malicious. Simona I do not act like this myself because I am secure and emotionally mature. so with respect your theory dose not add up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tejven!

I am really glad I found this post; it gave me a better view about different people and how to deal with them. I also found some of my own  characteristics in the post, and I don&#039;t mind being labeled because it is who I am. I&#039;m having a very (VERY) difficult time dealing with a few opinionated and egocentric people in my small class at college, I think this will help me in the future. Thank you!]]></description>

                Whenever we expect something for someone may be our parents,friend or any one &amp; full filled by same.we respect him/her ,love him/her but in some cases if our expectation not fullfilled.we hate the same people will tell bad infront of him/her even behind him.
 What this is Called human beings??
So for all,We should not keep the expectation from any one because this is one of the resion by which we feel number of times in stress.Live happy &amp; left the people to leave happily.
DO ONLY EXPECTATION FROM GOD &amp; ITSELF, NOT FOR OTHERS TO LIVE HAPPILY.

		<description><![CDATA[It is a nice grouping.  We can judge ourself in which category we fall.  And take corrective step or continue to be in the same category.  The choice is our.  I feel we need to change for our own betterment not for the sake of others.   Therefore the grouping is standard and we compare with the standard.   Joseph Melchior]]></description>
