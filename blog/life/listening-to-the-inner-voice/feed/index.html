		<description><![CDATA[This article forces me to think twice about what I am going to do. Is not so much what I do that triggers indecision but the after thoughts of all the things that can go wrong. As a result I am full of procrastination and believe that better times will come. I will try harder to realistically asses the pros &amp; cons. Try not to mix fear during the decision making process.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

I totally agree and that is the first time I have seen it put into words. I used to think I was blessed with a super strong instinct which was right every time but lots of it is as you say conditioning. Coming from a place of stillness and calm normally brings about the best course of action.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the category &quot;Don&#039;t act under the wrong impulse&quot; is even more challenging than just not responding out of emotion / anger.

A lot of times, what we believe is our &quot;instinct&quot; is actually conditioning we&#039;ve had for so long that we don&#039;t even realize it&#039;s conditioning.

That&#039;s the hardest kind of impulse to see through because it *feels* natural, even though it isn&#039;t.

Just more food for thought :)]]></description>
