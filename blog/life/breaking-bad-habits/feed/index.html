		<description><![CDATA[I am thankful that I just found your blog. It has the exact type of inspiration and sound advice that I can relate to and need. I&#039;m the parent of a child with special needs which has put me in the position of facing challenges that I never imagined would be a part of my life and am learning valuable lessons in the process. I am doing the best I can but sometimes I know that I could handle things even better if I seek out positive reinforcement. Tonight was such a night when I needed a few words of wisdom. Your blog is giving me a healthy way to cope. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that bad habits are often like an inverted pyramid. The base of it may be a tiny thing, but so much interdependent illusory thinking is added over time that the core habit we seek to eliminate is so entangled that removing it envolves much learning about ourselves.

When I quit smoking, I used the nicotine patches to go about removing the habitual thinking, then (separately) the drug habit of nicotine. Even as my nicotine was being supplied, I was surprised to recognize the mental/emotional programs that fired off (&quot;I need a cigarette because....). 

I learned my about my thinking patterns that experience gave me a perspective for questioning the validity of much of my view of my personal reality.

blessings to you and all you hold dear,
CG]]></description>
