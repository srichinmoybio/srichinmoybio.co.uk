		<description><![CDATA[X-mas present
All of my New Year&#039;s Resolutions in the eve were centered on the idea to climb up the peak lying near our capital around 2000m high. On 1 st of January in obviously really sleeping city  surroundings I went out quitely. I bought few things to fuel and met with my friends to head up to the top. This was the strongest mountain wind in honor of 1st I guess and since this was part of my resolution to climb up we had to do it through very fierce, blowing away wind. It was like in a tibetian snow desert. No noses, no hands, almost blind eyes at the cosmic peak. there we took a break in the hut embracing the hot stove and then down the slope running to catch the bus. seriouslly I was with kind of city shoes good enouh for climbing, but the funny part is I run with them better than with trainers so well that actually I caught the bus to the city. 10 min from my home I was still carying some chocolate and oranges in my bag wandering why they&#039;ve survived since we always eat everything when we go climbing. Then with shining eyes two may be gipsy beggar  children wanted to sing me a song for the New Year wich they did with great joy and I gave them fruit and sweets with great joy  so we have to have happiness all. This was the nicest X-mas present (from God).]]></description>
