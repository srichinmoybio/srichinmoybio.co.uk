		<description><![CDATA[Good list for a short article on such a broad topic.  I&#039;m surprised how many people include so many elements of what NOT to do though instead of what to do.  If you know 10 things not to do, it still doesn&#039;t mean you are doing better things instead of those, just different.  So to me, to be a better person you need to pick all the things you WILL actually do, instead of not doing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please accept this with my typing errors corrected! -Jiddu Krishnamurti used to say, “You are the world, and the world is you”. He didn’t explain this particularly well but he was correct in what he said, both materially and psychologically. I won’t take up space here in providing my own explanation (perhaps another time!); however, it is true to say that everything is part of everything else and there are no truly separate things. It follows that the good you do has to affect the world (the converse is also true). It also follows that the good you do to others you also do to yourself, because you are not truly separate. Let me share a story: years ago I was in a hospital car park and had no change for the ticket machine. I asked a lady who was passing whether she could change a £5 note and she just handed me the £2 I needed for the fee. I thanked her profusely and she said, “It’s OK; it’ll come back to me one day”. I’m sure she didn’t just mean, “The £2 will come back” but “The goodwill will flow my way”. I will never forget this lovely but simple gesture. Her goodwill flows on here; who knows where it will reach?]]></description>
