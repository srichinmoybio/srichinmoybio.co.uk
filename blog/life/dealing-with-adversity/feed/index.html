		<description><![CDATA[I do not believe that difficulties are unavoidable. Of course, we all have challenges in our lives, but it is only up to us if we choose to struggle against them. 

When you are not in the flow of life, you are struggling. Negative emotions always indicate that you are going against the flow. 

If you could just let go of that negativity and follow what feels good, you would so quickly get into the flow of life. 

People struggle only becose they choose to do so. Struggle always shows that this is not the right way to go, yet some people would do anything to get ahead, although all life forces try to stop them from taking the wrong action. 

Yet some struggle so hard that after years of hard work they actually &#039;succeed&#039; - only to find out that this feels not as good as they thought it would.

After some time (a year or two) they feel empty and unhappy. 

It is so much easier just to get into the flow of life and be guided by your feelings. What feels good is always good, you should always pursue whatever you are drawn towards. 

We have feelings for a very good reason. They guide us and warn us if we are about to take the action that will get us into trouble. Yet just a few use their feelings to their fullest potential.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Without the darkness we wouldn&#039;t appreciate the light, if there wouldn&#039;t be any &quot;bad&quot;, we wouldn&#039;t see all the good…

I think we should fully enjoy all those moments that are free from adversity, but when we have to face difficult moments (and sooner or later we all have to), we shouldn&#039;t try to hide or to run away… Instead we should become aware of the immense potential for personal growth that lies in adversity and use it as a vehicle towards more growth, enlightenment and awareness… and as we arrive there, we can once again fully enjoy all the happiness and fulfillment we gained through this transformational experience.

Thank you very much for this great article ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can see your perspective and where you are coming from in Adversity (continued difficulty), but I feel it really comes down to Diversity (a variety in differences).

I have expanded hugely in conscious growth through Adversity and I do give it credit and value, but I have reached a point in my conscious awareness experience, where Adversity can be avoided through the filter of Diversity. I find that the expansion is still huge and much rewarding without the &#039;pain&#039; of difficulty. 

When I push myself to grow through Diversity, Adversity seems to disappear. Perhaps Adversity is designed to push people forward when they stop growing consciously? 

Pain is not needed, it&#039;s only a perspective that is lacking an awareness of what is unfolding. In my experience, life doesn&#039;t have to be suffering, quite the opposite indeed.

In fact Diversity is so important for growth that is actually an emotional need. This need is the essence of excitement and creativity. To feel a sense of surprise. To feel the invitation of something new. To add variety to your life. To feel the feeling of stimulation and growth.

Very thought-proving article, thank you! :)]]></description>
