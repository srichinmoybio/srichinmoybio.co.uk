		<description><![CDATA[This is a very true paradigm.  Keeping things simple is absolutely key in attaining inner peace, self improvement and harmony.

This draws similar parallels to the 80/20 principle meaning less is more and this concept seems to elude much of society today.

If we all can simplify our lives we would actually receive more benefits for less effort.

Excellent article Tejvan.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Power of Simplicity. I have always been a firm believer in keeping it simple. most of us associate complexity with eminence.

Simplicity seems like a lack of effort and in mans futile desire to achieve his hights, he unnecessarily makes things complicated.

Thank you for your post. Check out this ebook i wrote of a similar theme:
