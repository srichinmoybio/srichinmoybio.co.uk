		<description><![CDATA[sometimes do our own business is  very important,i used to complain small things around me but finally i found some complaints are useless.Like you said above.But there are still some complaints ,they are really helpful.
So my point is that we should aviod unnecessary complaints.But if complain can help to solve the problem we need to try it.
I really like this site. The style is simple and tidy.Thanks.]]></description>

&quot;Does complaining help me resolve the issue and/or feel more joyful?&quot;

If the answer is &quot;No&quot; then I just drop the complaint and focus my attention elsewhere.]]></description>
