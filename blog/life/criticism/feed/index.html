		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s criticism and then there&#039;s constructive criticism. If criticism is judgmental or condemning, and doesn&#039;t spur you on to positive solutions, then it&#039;s not constructive. On the other hand, constructive criticism is motivated by a desire to help you improve your performance, change negative behavior and tap your true potential. When employed correctly, criticism can be one of the greatest benefits for helping us to become better in life and work. It is less likely to make us feel guarded or defensive.

this is really very important article  that greatly can enhnace or destroy people lives .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;For example, point out the mistake but don’t add unnecessary judgments about how bad they are to do it.&quot;

I think that&#039;s the most critical element of all of this.  When we honestly remove judgment from our criticisms... they really just become constructive critiques, which is invaluable.

I actually talk a lot about this topic in my upcoming ebook devoted to helping others utilize story writing as a path for spiritual growth.

I also think an important element on this topic is compassion.  The more genuine compassion we have for somebody, the more we:

1) Will intuitively know when is the right time to critique and in which ways

2) Will connect with the other person at a deeper level because they&#039;ll know we aren&#039;t saying things to hurt them (although sometimes the truth hurts), but rather we genuinely care for their welfare and just want to help them towards leading a more peaceful, happy, and fulfilling life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice post Tejvan! Sri Chinmoy once told one of his students that if a person does nine bad things and one good thing, always focus on and encourage that one good thing - forget the rest. There is nothing like being around people who only see the good in others - it is like a breath of fresh air. When we see the good in others it also creates a positive environment for enlightenment - fertile soil for positive change as it were. And that is so helpful in so many ways. Thanks for this very encouraging post.]]></description>
