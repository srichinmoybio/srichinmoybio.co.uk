		<description><![CDATA[Personally I&#039;m stuck in emotional hurt over someone I always knew was &quot;wrong&quot;. Yet,I got hurt anyway. I absolutely need to let go. They keep contacting me,even though physically they&#039;ve moved on. It&#039;s all very exhausting but I did enjoy finding this website. I will use it as a reference. Strength of mind is so important. I need that now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting!!!!
Someone hurts us or we have a negative experience. Rather than brush away the pain, many of us get stuck emotionally, lick our wounds, allow ourselves to become afraid. Time passes and it becomes harder to move forward. Before we know it, years have passed. To become more fulfilled in the present and more excited about the future, many of us need to learn to let go of the past.]]></description>
