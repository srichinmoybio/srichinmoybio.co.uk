		<description><![CDATA[The third point.  Don&#039;t expect from other people.  If you expect from other people, you will be disappointed.  This is socially crippling.  Every relationship has needs and expectations so for us to not have expectations would require us to not build meaningful relationships.   I lived my life this way for many years, trying to not having expectations of others or myself, and found I couldn&#039;t develop meaningful relationships and I was always disappointed with myself.  I became a lonely man.  

The solution for me..... ACCEPT DISAPPOINTMENT.  Don&#039;t be so hard on others for disappointing you.  Don&#039;t be so hard on yourself for disappointing others and accept the disappointment.   Don&#039;t scrap relationships or change expectations because of a little disappointment.  Hang on to the valuable relationships and help nurture the person you are, by accepting our disappointment and accepting that we will fail our expectations and the expectations of others.  It&#039;s o k. to feel disappointment. Let the feeling come in and pass.
