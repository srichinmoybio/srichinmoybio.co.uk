		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re personal development articles are great. Just now, I wrote a comment on the post on gaining respect on how useful it was. 

Have to hand it to you. You&#039;re articles never lose the charm and never seem commercially-fueled like some other bloggers of the same category. 

Focus on both, ok ? I just love all your post topics. Not flattering. Its really nice. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually Tejvan, no probs if there are astrophysics articles. I mean, I love that topic. And, I&#039;m a hobby astronomer and I admire Nicola Tesla and Einstein. 

Anyway, its great there is another writer. I think I&#039;ve just one tip for you. Focus more on meditation topics. Because thats what makes this site special. Good luck.]]></description>
