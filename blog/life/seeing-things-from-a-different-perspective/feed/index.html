		<description><![CDATA[Very nicely presented. Thank you for reminding that the choice is ours. :-)

I wonder if you might write about a similar topic. Namely, &#039;mirror image&#039;. As in, our view of people or things is often a &#039;reflection&#039; of ourselves. This is something I believe but often have a hard time describing and/or holding the concept/meaning in my mind. And of course making wise choices based on an awareness of &#039;mirror image&#039; is an everyday occurrence.

Your posts are really helpful thank you!
