		<description><![CDATA[Hello Trejvan,
Thank you Chris for recommending my website on Courage.

I love the points you make about fear.  It begins early in people&#039;s lives and gains momentum. The news media is a huge fear generator.  Fear is toxic.  The fastest way to push away a beautiful life is to live in fear.  You get to choose.  Love and fear cannot co-exist in the same space.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tejvan,

You have posted an interesting article indeed. I have two questions basis what you have written.

A) Assuming the role of fear predominantly arises during an individual&#039; interaction with the world. Basis this premises, when we would want to give a lot to others and our expectations revolve around this &quot;Giving&quot; aspect, for various reasons, sometime the outcome does not match up with what we wanted as an outcome.

When I say Outcome, I mean both the direct result of any act OR importantly, the way how the outcome was perceived by another human being. One has a fear of the person not getting what I intend to give.

What should one do?

2) Living in the now - I am sure you would agree, though we want to live in the now, we seldom discover we are in that state in totality. 

The role of past, and expected future always comes into one&#039;s mind in any normal day..

I have done some research on this arena and learnt, the two hemispheres of our brains i.e., left &amp; right functions differently to the extent that both of the hemispheres posses its own personality. 

To eloborate further, one hemisphere absorbs everything thats happening around in a parallen fashion through our sensory organs. On the other hand, the other hemisphere contantly takes inputs from the other hemisphere i.e., simultenous inputs and latches onto either past references and tries to use to foresee future with the information gathered from sensory inputs - To me, this means, intrinsically we are dual natured. Now, how would you talk about &quot;Living in the Now&quot; when we are designed to be dual-natured?

I look forward to hearing from you.]]></description>
