		<description><![CDATA[The path of Bodhisattva, indeed, includes the ability of distinguishing attachment and compassion (love for all lives). Thanks, I learn what to cope now. The mind itself is clustered with thoughts(emotional, knowledge) and our body stimuli, by recognizing the nature of mind, which is endless and restless, we rest our nature within from chasing after them, because they cannot be owned. Thanks, we need to love from our heart, not the mind which stipulates all sorts of addictive behaviour towards others until she/he becomes merely an item of pleasure. In which Buddha said all six senses (the last one is consciousness, includes sub-consciousness) are merely phenomenal and numbs our real &#039;self&#039;(this &#039;self&#039; is merely used as a object to describe, one can only truly understand when they experience, start from resting the mind through meditation).
After all, I was actually troubled by my emotions that I&#039;ve gone attached to a girl at current grade 12, where I got too troubled(my academic still good^^). Shall I make a retreat from her in terms of my Facebook pursuit, school pursuit and emotional entanglement. (fortunately, we&#039;re still in friends state, where the burden of emotion ain&#039;t that strong as it is for the couples.) I just know her three months! -.-&#039;&#039; Sry, but the first paragraph is quite useful(depends on ur degree of understanding)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with most of your points in this post.  I feel as if a love where your partner loves you more than you love yourself is a recipe for emotional dependence.  While when sharing your life with someone there will be times when you rely upon them to be strong when you cannot be, it should not be constant.  The one thing I disagree with is that you should not have expectations for your partner.  I think as humans it is impossible to rid ourselves of expectation.  We can, however, both manage and communicate our expectations.  They should be fluid and it you should never expect someone to behave in a way in which you have not shared,  lovers are not mind readers!]]></description>
