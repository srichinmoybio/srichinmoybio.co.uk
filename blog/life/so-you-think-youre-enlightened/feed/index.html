		<description><![CDATA[Excellent post and something I have been thinking about lately. It seems that &quot;Enlightenment&quot; is often held out to us like the carrot and the stick. Do this practice and you will receive the &quot;ultimate gift&quot; and you will live happily ever after. It is presented as another &quot;thing&quot; to have along with all your other prized possessions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This post is such a good reminder of the never ending journey that personal development. So many people start to better themselves in order to get somewhere, to arrive. Then they realize that where they&#039;ve arrived at is just the starting point for the next journey.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in agreement with Chris.  If there&#039;s any sense of achievement or striving within our spiritual development, then enlightenment eludes us.

The more I move forward on my spiritual path, the less I find myself caring about concepts such as &quot;enlightenment.&quot;  

Blessings,
Andrea]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this article because it really touches on the challenge... the catch 22 of a spiritual path:

&quot;If you think you&#039;re enlightened, then you&#039;re not.&quot;

The mere act of applying that label to ourselves shows that we&#039;re not living in the present, but rather, the past.

So in reality, the only time we can be enlightened is when we&#039;re not aware that we&#039;re enlightened.

And ironically, this happens to us more often than we realize - by sheer virtue of the fact that we don&#039;t realize it&#039;s happening.

When we immerse ourselves into those moments of presence, that is our true enlightenment. Maybe it&#039;s for just a moment or a few minutes... in my experience it&#039;s difficult to maintain that state for extended periods of time.  After all, I do have &quot;parents&quot; (or another way to look at it is - being human in our society).

But I do know that each and every moment of presence lays the foundation for more presence.  Each one is another opening to let the light shine through.]]></description>
