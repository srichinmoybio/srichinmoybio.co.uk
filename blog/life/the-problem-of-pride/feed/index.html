		<description><![CDATA[About Pride. Sounds simple, it only takes about ten years to realise the cause of your sufferings and to swallow it, if you can.
&quot;The camel that eat thorns&quot; such a beautiful allegory,

yes with bleeding mouth, but green eyes. She has a journey ahead, after all.  Thanks for the post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good article, pride is the killer of everything good and has no place in the life of a successful person. I guess it&#039;s a life long task to kill pride and the ego, but thank for reminding us, a good prod always helps.]]></description>
