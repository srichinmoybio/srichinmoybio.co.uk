		<description><![CDATA[You hit the nail on the head, Evelyn. The mind so often gets its thought from the things it takes in from the outside world, so why not have a daily schedule of taking in positive thoughts throught inspirational reading?

		<description><![CDATA[Hello, I particularly like your advice &quot;Try every day to have a diet of inspirational reading or watching; this will help in turbulent times to release you from your self absorbed thought-prison and back on the road to actively look for a way forward.&quot;

This is what I do everyday, so that I keep my positive vibes up.  When I read, my thoughts follow the inspirational words of the article or book.  They help prevent me from falling back into negative thinking.

Thanks!
