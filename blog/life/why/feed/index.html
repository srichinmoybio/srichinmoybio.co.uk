Because it ease easier to busy and run away from our inner weaknesses than it is to be still and face them.

Because it is easier to convince with reputation than it is to convince with passion.

Because in complexity we find excuses to hide our unproductive actions.

Because it is easier to practice ignorance than it is to practice empathy.

Because it is easier to complain than it is to change.

Because it is easier to complain than it is to change.

Because it is easier to speak than it is to be still.

Because we take much and give little. 

Because we are afraid to fail.

Because it is easier to follow the norm than it is to follow your dreams.]]></description>
