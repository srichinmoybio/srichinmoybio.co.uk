		<description><![CDATA[o.k. a new one:

We did a play with dolls called the Golden Swan by Sri Chinmoy in  an art gallery in Sofia. There the dolls, hand made by a friend of mine  Urdhagati,  were exhibited. There were around 20 children watching attentively and I could hear my voice so clear transferring to them a realm from the story, but even if the children where silent, I could hear them… they were behind a curtain but I was watching and smiling at them with the eyes of the doll in my hand, Sissy - she was one personage. And at the end of the play, since we had a scene with all the feathers of the golden swan being plugged out, the children came one by one in a line to get a feather of the golden swan.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had recently left a place that I loved to dance at.  I was very sad to leave and was afraid I would get hurt trying a new studio and a new type of dance.  Guess what...I got hurt.  At first the lonely feeling felt worse than the physical pain, then I realized that my fear had left as well, lifting my perceived burden.  I feel lighter now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wish to share such moments, this little signs for which I want to be grateful and not forgetful, if I can count them in one moment in my life they will make a beautiful garland, who will for sure wipe off all the ugliness from the rest. but I must remember all. 
and here they comes,
 if you are bored you can stop at any moment,
but I will be happy to continue, just counting them
the pieces of the garland,
The day I had not so bright start of the day
and I was in this slow metal tram,
when a child had to climb up the big stairs,
three years old and he stretch  his hand to pull him up,
Inside me I was rather dark green with even darker spots,
But I had to force myself to smile at him,
Because I wanted him at least have a great start of the day.
Ad then the little child smiled back at me,
His soul smiled back at me
And I forgot all.
It was a day I had to put forks and knifes 
On the tables in the restaurant,
I don’t like to have too many or too little of them,
So I grab a pile and took one extra,
Then started placing them on the white tables,
There was no extra, no less
I was content inside and I was so happy.
One day I put a flower on a stone corner,
Next day I found another one just there,
It was happening, the garland was leaving.
