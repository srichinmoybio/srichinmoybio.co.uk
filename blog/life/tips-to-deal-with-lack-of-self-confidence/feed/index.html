		<description><![CDATA[Smiling is catching. If you don&#039;t believe me, smile at a few individuals over the next few time. Don&#039;t grin like a fanatic (that just places other individuals off), just allow yourself to smile normally. You&#039;ll be pleased how many individuals will smile returning. Which, in convert, creates them seem user friendly and more friendly, which will help with your self esteem stages.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is very good and informative, deals with the key points of the problem. I am very low on confidence level. I was not like this before but when i lived with other more confident people than me, I started feeling low and speaking less. Though its my nature that I speak very little. Is there any way I can improve on this? I am an engineer but I have never become a good team player and leader because of it. Please help me]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would agree that these are good ideas however in practice they dont really work , not for me anyway,  listing positive qualities only makes me focus not only on the negative ones more so, since im trying to search for the good ones, but also makes me feel worse because if the only positive things i can think of are things like empathy. and other basic common human feelings then how special am i? Spending time with positive people is great as well but im 24 and most of the positive people that i know dont participially want to surround themselves with people who bring them down, and i mean bringing them down by just being themselves which they do if their the type of people like me who would be visiting a website like this. Be Yourself – Don’t Imitate- if your a person void of confidence and act in this way, then you are being yourself, and hence how is acting in this way going to make you feel better, for me it makes me feel worse and worse everyday i wake up.  Faking confidence in this situation is always better than being your self without it because even though you would feel the same way at least you will see some results in work, relationships etc. Don’t think of failure.... when the average person does anything in a repeated way throughout their life, look for jobs, relationships, anything like that, failure is normally the repeated end result, not to succeed, positive enforcement is only enforcement, not a miracle idea that gets rid of insecurities, doubts, panic and everything else that contributes to low self esteem. im sorry if anyone takes offence to this.]]></description>
