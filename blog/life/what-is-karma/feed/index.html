		<description><![CDATA[Tejvan,

I have friends who firmly believe in the art of karma. They live their life vicariously through this mantra.

Yet to me, it seems hard to believe that every little thing we do has a direct cause and effect to our future. 

I completely agree with your view that &quot;A danger about the law of karma is that we take a view that if people suffer, they must deserve it&quot;

We must treat others equally, no one person should suffer. And as a pessimist towards Karma, I don&#039;t judge people&#039;s suffering as being an affliction of bad karma.

Just my two cents.]]></description>
