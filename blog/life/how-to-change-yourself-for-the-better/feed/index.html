		<description><![CDATA[My marriage has been on the rocks and this article is exactly what i want to do to make things better. Not only for me, but for my wife, my son and the life we all share together. I will bookmark this page and try to read it at least once every day. When you are used to doing things a certain way all the time change is very hard. But it all comes down to mind over matter. you cant expect things to get better passing the blame, making excuses, or just outright being an ass and not realizing what you do have and what you stand to lose if you don&#039;t change. thank you so much and good luck to everyone who desires to change their lives for the better]]></description>
