I&#039;m just upset and depressed this past few days...i know i have to understand others to be understood.I&#039;ve learned that it&#039;s better to remain silent that fight back on others who just focus on my negative part.Anyway..i didn&#039;t make decision just to please others..i dont care if they don&#039;t like...well i&#039;m just hurt..people will really love us for so many reason but will hate us right away just for one mistakes.I wonder if what&#039;s the difference between concern and being strict to someone,i guess theres a big difference between them...but i can&#039;t blame others,they easily react without even trying to know the real meaning why other people did something..well as what i have mentioned PEOPLE WILL LOVE US FOR SO MANY REASON BUT WILL JUST HATE US RIGHT AWAY EVEN WITH JUST SINGLE MISTAKE.I wonder if what&#039;s in their mind why...oh no,i can&#039;t explain it.Well,maybe,i guess...they were really like that.Oh...i&#039;m just hurt..i&#039;m just hurt...well thanks for taking some time to read my message...i&#039;ll be okay later.I know i don&#039;t have to change my principle just to please them...i dont have plans to please people...Lord..help me overcome this...i&#039;m hurt!...i just want to voice out..before my tears will fall..but it doesn&#039;t mean that i will give up...i will never give up..i know someone up there loves me unconditionally...thanks for the time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Everything happens for a reason.&quot;We can&#039;t always see everything coming our way. Take life for what it is. It is what we make it.As we partake in this journey called life we must realize that we are in control of our own destiny. Thank you for keeping us informed and to realize how important our life is. Noone can live it for us, we should be in charge of our lives because we live it once and once is enough if you work it right. Thank you once again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another great post. I really like what you write and it always seem so obvious. How comes we don&#039;t realize these things ourselves? ;)

But that&#039;s why it&#039;s good to have people like you reminding us of these things! Now we just need to implement them ... :)

Have a nice day. Namaste.]]></description>
