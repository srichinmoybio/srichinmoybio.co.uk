		<description><![CDATA[I have a poster of Buddha that has his quote on it, which says: 
&quot;The secret of health for both mind and body, is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future or anticipate trouble, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly.&quot; 
Every time i think of the past mistakes or failiures i remember Buddha, and that gets my mind to concentrate on the present.]]></description>
