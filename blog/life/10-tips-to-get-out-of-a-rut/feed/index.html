		<description><![CDATA[This is one of the best advice posts I&#039;ve read for a life lift. Thank you. All these suggestions work for real. Two additional things that really help me is practising gratitude, particularly for my health and wellbeing as without it, I really would be stuck in a rut and actively questioning my motives for my behaviour or choices. Once you start doing this, just asking yourself, Why am I doing this? What is the point or purpose? you&#039;ll find you&#039;ll change overnight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello all,

If you are feeling stuck in a rut, and would like to change your life, I would love to speak with you.

I myself was once caught in a horrible rut – a truly awful, powerless experience that took me years to break out of. I now help teach people how to break out of ruts and truly change their lives.

I&#039;m thinking of writing a book, and would love to interview anyone who feels they are stuck in a rut. I&#039;ll give my best advice (for free!) just to learn more about this problem.

If you&#039;re interested,send me an email at danielbarrett@gmail.com so we can get in touch. Thanks!]]></description>
