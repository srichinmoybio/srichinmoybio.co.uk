I hope I could change this way of thinking but sometimes I get distracted when there are obstacles. I hope you continue on giving life lessons I need it very badly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This really is a awesome site. these are not merely words but pearls of wisdom. In my constant quest to be a better person &amp; achiving a calm mind, this seems like a friend who has come just in time to guide me. once a month i become a irritated monster &amp; have absolutely no control over my thoughts or emotions. though i know its a medical problem, i don&#039;t want to take any medication but solve it myself from the inner strength. hope i will achive this goal. Thanks a lot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jayney, 

Definitely others will see it, but you are doing it for you, not for them :)
And about being concerned about what they think - some people will always criticize no matter what you do, you just have to go ahead and do it anyway...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, this advice is so timely  and given the chance it works 

&#039;Focus on increasing the opposite quality

It is always a much more rewarding task to increase positive qualities than reduce negative ones&#039; 

But my inner doubt wonders if others can see this - and indeed, should I be concerned about what they think?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow!  This is so timely for me.  Having come face to face with a rather unknown to me weakness in my life last week really has me doing a lot of self-doubting.  I&#039;m doing so good with the not criticizing others that I&#039;m neglecting the not criticizing myself.

I really needed the &quot;you are not your problems&quot; today.  Great analogy with the cloud/sun.

Thanks!]]></description>
