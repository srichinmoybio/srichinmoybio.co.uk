		<description><![CDATA[Great article Tejvan, and thanks for the link love.

When I wrote &quot;5 Signs You Are On Autopilot&quot; I didn&#039;t expect such of a response. But the article exploded, even featuring on Lifehacker. There are many, many people who would answer &quot;yes&quot; to these questions, so hopefully they come across this article! I have given it a stumble to help this happen :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article, Tejvan. Many a times, people tend to look outside for answers to their purpose in life. When in fact, whatever they want and need to know, is all right inside of them. 

Cheers,
