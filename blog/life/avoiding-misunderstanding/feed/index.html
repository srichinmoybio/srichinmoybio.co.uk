But sometimes that&#039;s hard because she will cut u off and interupt. She is not a good listener plus her self esteem is quite low and with those two together conversations are a job and unenjoyable. I just have to practice being more clear and saying what I mean and meaning what I say.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;Because we doubt ourselves we assume that people are liable to be thinking badly about us.&#039;

what should I do when someone is doing this about me? Their reactions and comments show they are assuming I am thinking badly of them.

I&#039;m thinking I should just ignore it but my intuition won&#039;t let me...and the intuition is different from a nagging inner voice going on.]]></description>
