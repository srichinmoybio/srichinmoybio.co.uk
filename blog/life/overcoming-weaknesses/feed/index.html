		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I appreciate your article on overcoming weaknesses and agree that dwelling on negative things is not the right thing to do. I also believe focusing on good things and our goals is the right thing to do. 

I&#039;ve also learned that sometimes it is necessary to acknowledge and respond to bad things as there are some bad things that can&#039;t be avoided, must be addressed and then we can move on from there. 

Thanks again for your great content and contributions in helping others be their best.

		<description><![CDATA[Today I had such a day, where I was blaming myself. But then I thought back and reminded myself that I could not do it any other way with the knowledge I had. I then blamed someone else. But at the end, I have to live with how things are. I read somewhere that when you blame anyone, you should day several times: &quot;I love, I love...&quot;. And it helps.]]></description>
