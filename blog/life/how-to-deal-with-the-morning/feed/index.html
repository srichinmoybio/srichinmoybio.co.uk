		<description><![CDATA[Here is a small collection of quotes from wise souls about the benefits of early morning:


“The breeze at dawn
has secrets to tell you.

Don&#039;t go back to sleep.
-Rumi




There is something very wonderful to be said about dawn.  Sunset is good, too.  The only thing is, at sunset most everybody is awake and they’re hurrying and scurrying around.  At dawn most everybody is slowed down or asleep and they are much more harmonious when they’re asleep.  So dawn is often a good time for spiritual things.
--
When you feel te need of a spiritual lift, try getting to bed early and get up early to have a quiet time at dawn.  Then carry the “in tune” feeling that comes to you into your day no matter what you may be doing.
- Peace Pilgrim


It is well to be up before daybreak, for such habits contribute to health, wealth, and wisdom.
- Aristotle


Also, for those who have not heard of Peace Pilgrim, she is a wonderful soul who gave her life to service, and expressed methods of gaining inner peace in the most practical, simple, and giving way I have found.  All her words are found free on her website:
