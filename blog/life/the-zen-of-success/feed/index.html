		<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for such a beautiful description of success. If somebody asks me about success, I thinks many of the people will agree that it doesnt come overnight without a sack of obstacles, problems, hurdles etc etc.
I just stepped the first &quot;S&quot; of success with nmerous failures in last 7 to 8 years. well I will share my story of success when I am posted on this site.
thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Success often conjures up ideas of trophies, gaining money, power and prestige. But, why does success have to be synonymous with ‘winning’ something.’

I loved this section as it articulates how I feel about how I can now live my life. If only I was literate enough to describe it better I could tell you……..but thank you for these words.

		<description><![CDATA[Here’s a quote from one of my website page that I though would interest you. My website is given from above. You will find more great inspirational written material on similar topic that those on your website.

“The best way to learn something is to dive right in to it. When we overcome our fear of failure, we learn that only those who are asleep make no mistakes. Fear is the only thing keeping us from experiencing a life of love and fulfillment. If we make a commitment to an uncompromisable quest for truth, we will realize that as we grow more into the truth, our fears start to disappear.”]]></description>
