		<description><![CDATA[Tejvan, I found your writing this morning by chance and what a wonderful practical advice resource for everyone. I&#039;m already back and I am sure I&#039;ll be visiting often when I need a little life lifting reminder. Venus Cow, the site I&#039;ve chosen to link back to, has also helped me so much so I hope you don&#039;t mind me sharing the free life coaching with your readers. &quot;It is the space between the notes that makes the music.&quot; ML]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A lot of things in this post resonate deeply with my own experience.

It often seems difficult to change your life or implement some of the suggestions talked about in self-help books, but I find it interesting that the things you talk about here, in some sense, are also very easy.  I particularly like your advice about not rushing, about taking moments of silence, reflection, and meditation.  I think that nearly all of us have tremendous capacity for wisdom and good decision-making, which we often ignore, but which we can easily tap into if we only give ourself the opportunity to.

I find that a lot of problems in our lives can be solved almost effortlessly if we simply ask ourselves, in the moment, if we really want to say or do certain things.]]></description>
