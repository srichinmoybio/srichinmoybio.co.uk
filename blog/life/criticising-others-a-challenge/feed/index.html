		<description><![CDATA[I have been working on this a lot in the last few years (admittingly, on and off) after reading Deepak Chopra&#039;s &#039;the seven spirtual laws of success&#039;. I agree with Rob, it&#039;s a habit. At first i was shocked to notice how much i criticised people and situations. It&#039;s a tough habit to change, but with time, i&#039;ve made some good progress (but still have a long way to go!).  

I think it&#039;s also very important to not criticise yourself!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I found that the less I criticized myself, the less I criticized others.  The real challenge is this:

- While doing this exercise, to avoid criticizing ourselves when we notice ourselves criticizing others!

It&#039;s so easy to get caught into that trap... but if we learn to have compassion for ourselves... if we learn to be curious about our criticism by asking questions like, &quot;That&#039;s an interesting thought.  I wonder why I criticized that person?&quot; then we have an opportunity for every powerful transformation.

&quot;So within... so without...&quot;

Long story short: If we can have compassion for ourselves during this challenging exercise, it&#039;ll be a lot easier!]]></description>
