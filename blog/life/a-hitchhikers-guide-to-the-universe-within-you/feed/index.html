		<description><![CDATA[This touches upon a wonderful experience I had with the Gateway Voyage residential program that The Monroe Institute offers.

Basically, they use audio technology (binaural beats) to help people reach a deeper state of meditation more quickly.  Then through the use of audio cues, the participant is guided towards exploring their inner world through that deepened meditation.

Sometimes the experiences are visual, or auditory, or just &quot;feeling.&quot;  Sometimes blank.  All kinds of experiences, but ultimately they all remind me of your hitchhiker analogy... just to really explore, be present with the experience, and have fun with curiosity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this beautiful perspective on inner exploration. I&#039;ve found it hard to motivate myself to meditate before, but after this, I can barely wait!

Blessings!]]></description>
