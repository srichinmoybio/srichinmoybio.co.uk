		<description><![CDATA[Excellent article!  I think it&#039;s especially important to surround ourselves with like-minded people, or even people who have already created some of what we wish to create in our own lives.  We tend to attract people with like motivations, which keeps us in the same place.  Stepping beyond our circle can often expand our consciousness.

Blessings,
Andrea]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve covered most of, if not all, the ways to regain motivation, but please allow me to add this -- stop thinking about the lost motivation and START doing something, anything!

Often times, we find ourselves thinking about &quot;stuff&quot; and ways if we actually invest the same amount of time into actually &quot;doing&quot; stuff, we&#039;d be surprised at the things that we can achieve :D]]></description>
