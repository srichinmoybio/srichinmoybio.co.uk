		<description><![CDATA[This article provides great information for overcoming phobia! thanks for the post!
@Shaun- agree with you that the only way to overcome fear is to face it. No matter how much support friends and family members provide, it would be all futile if we choose to run away and leave that scar inside us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great read! The only real way to overcome a fear is to face it. Usually you will find that your fear isn&#039;t as bad as you initially thought. I have overcome many fears and phobias simply by forcing myself to face them.  Most people can&#039;t just simply force themselves to experience something that frightens them. So it&#039;s nice that you have a list of steps that can help them out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fears and phobias can be awful and you certainly experienced one of the scariest ones. I like your steps that you outlined to overcome these. I know that they will benefit many.

You might not be aware of this, but there are also other ways to eliminate fears, and some of them are quite easy and quick.

Because a fear is simply a thought, you are correct in that we have the ability to be aware of our thoughts and change them.

Many people unfortunately don&#039;t believe that they can, so they find someone like me to help them.

I use hypnosis and teach my clients hypnosis.
I also use EFT (The Emotional Freedom Technique) and teach all of my clients this tool also.

If you want to learn for yourself - contact me. I&#039;m happy to help you over SKYPE or google+. It&#039;s what I do everyday :-)]]></description>
