There is one thing we all agree on &#8211; that love is what makes the world go round, and that without it, the world is but a dry empty shell of a place. On the other hand, it is a word we very easily twist around to our own purposes to justify our emotional dependence on a person. If we can learn to distinguish love from emotional dependence and put this distinction into practice, then we make life more beautiful not only for us, but for everyone we come into contact with.</p>
<p><strong>1. Learn to love yourself first</strong></p>
<p align="center"><em>Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie, which we ascribe to heaven.</em></p>
<p align="right">~William Shakespeare</p>
<p>Often when we are emotionally dependent on someone, we are looking to them as a &#8216;filler&#8217; to cover over and distract us from unresolved emotional issues in ourselves. In order to truly love someone, we first have to discover and explore what love is, and that means starting with the person you spend the most time with &#8211; yourself! We can often name our shortcomings far quicker than our positive qualities, and we are very quick to beat ourselves up for anything we didn&#8217;t do to our satisfaction. This all has to change. Try every day to identify your positive qualities and bring them more to the fore and increase them, and when you do make a mistake, try and see it as a &#8216;work-in-progress&#8217; rather than an absolute failure. When your own self-love and self-respect increases, you are then able to approach relationships with others with much more equanimity.</p>

<p>Self improvement is a continuous struggle to better ourselves; it the aspiration to transcend our weaknesses and limitations. There is no quick fix for our self development; it requires perseverance, patience and a constant aspiration to lead a better life. These are some of the factors that will expedite our progress.</p>
<p><strong>1. Don&#8217;t Just Talk</strong></p>
<p>It is easy to spend several hours reading and talking about making changes to our life. But, all the books in the world won&#8217;t help unless we can make real changes to our life. Books can give us inspiration, but, for every book we read it can take many years to actually understand and implement the changes in our lives. Similarly it is good to talk and articulate what we should do, but the real test is whether we can practise what we preach.</p>
<p><strong>2. Discipline / regularity</strong></p>
<p>Self improvement is not something that can do once a week when we feel like it. Self improvement requires a certain discipline and regularity. For many discipline brings to mind negative connotations of doing something we don&#8217;t really want to. However, the discipline here is really the motivation to continue doing the right thing.  If something is good to do, there is no need to just do it occasionally. After a while our discipline to create good habits, no longer feels like discipline; we want to do it simply because this is what we enjoy doing. Our bad habits no longer seem attractive.</p>
<p><strong>3. Think of others</strong></p>
<p>Self improvement doesn&#8217;t mean we focus excessively on ourselves. It is a paradox of self improvement that real progress comes when we give less importance to our ego and give more consideration to others. When we think of others a little more and ourselves a little less, we will definitely make progress in becoming a better person.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Wisdom ceases to be wisdom when it becomes too proud to weep, too grave to laugh, and too selfish to seek other than itself.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Khalil Gibran</p>
<p>Is it possible for man to be completely selfless? A cynic may say not. But, selfless actions and thoughts are not only possible, but  give a real sense of satisfaction and abiding happiness.</p>
<p>What do we mean by real selflessness? Selflessness means we act without thought for how we will profit or be rewarded. If we give help to others, but expect recognition or the favour to be returned, this is not a selfless action. True selflessness means we would do the action, even if it was never know to anyone else. Selflessness means we identify with others. Our service to others is not an act of condescending charity in helping others, our action is motivated by a feeling of oneness. We help others because we identify with their problems and their suffering. Selflessness is its own reward.</p>
<h3>Benefits of selflessness</h3>
<p><strong>Conquers Pride.</strong></p>
<p>In a true selfless action we are not acting to feed our ego and receive the flattery of the world; we are not acting out of competition or desire to prove ourself to others. Selflessness means we act out of a motivation to do the right thing and help others. By definition, selflessness cannot involve inflating our ego, it does exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>Many people begin a meditation practice with tremendous enthusiasm and excitement about the possiblilities of self-discovery, only to let it go after a few weeks or months as the initial novelty wears off. How can you keep up a meditation practice and, in addition, continue it with the same inspiration and freshness as you had when you first began to meditate? Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<p><strong>Set a proper time each day.</strong></p>
<p>Quite often the reason why a meditation practice gets pushed to the sidelines is that we don&#8217;t value it enough compared to the other things we have going on in our life.</p>
<p>Valuing your meditation practice means setting aside a definite time each day &#8211; even if it is only 10 minutes &#8211; that is dedicated to meditation, and non-negotiable as regards moving/cancelling to make room for something else. The best time is undoubtedly as soon as you wake up in the morning. Firstly, there is much less likelihood of unforeseen distractions and secondly, the atmosphere is much more tranquil, allowing you to have deeper meditative experiences and take the inner peace from those experiences as you enter into the day.</p>
<p><strong>Your own special space</strong></p>
<p>It is best if you have some part of your house dedicated solely for the purpose of your daily meditation, a place set aside for yourself and your own self-discovery. You can decorate this space with anything that inspires you and brings the beautiful qualities in you to the fore &#8211; candles, pictures of mountains or sunsets or any nature scene, fresh flowers, a statue of the Christ or the Buddha if you are religiously inclined, beautiful poetry that inspires you to go deep within &#8211; you can really make this place your own Aladdin&#8217;s Cave of inner wealth and treasures, so that every time you sit down, you are automatically reminded of the goal of self-awareness you are striving for through meditation. As you go deeper into meditation, you will find out different things that inspire you, and you can continually update your meditation space to reflect that.</p>
<p><strong>A constant sense of newness</strong></p>
<p>A successful meditation practice requires a constant sense of aspiration to get in touch with your inner nature. You need to find ways to continually regenerate this sense of enthusiasm and not drift into a sense of &#8216;same-old, same-old&#8217; and to do it out of routine &#8211; this has been the death-knell for many a meditation practice, as then the mind takes over and wonders why we are doing something so joyless in the first place.</p>
<p>Try changing elements of your meditation from time to time, incorporating readings, nature meditations, mantras, music or anything else that inspires you &#8211; if you have a spontaneous inner feeling to do something, then go with it!  Another thing that also helps is setting yourself little meditative projects, for example setting aside extra time to meditate once a week, learning new meditative songs, or chanting a series of mantras over a couple of weeks. Rather than sitting on ones laurels and being content with the same measure of inner peace you had yesterday, a meditation practice should always have a sense of adventure and exploration deeper into the self.</p>

Respect doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean we have to agree with everything they say; respect comes from people&#8217;s inner life, and the values and beliefs they hold. If someone is sincere, honest and self effacing it is easy to respect them, even if they believe in a different life philosophy. If we can understand why some people instinctively gain respect, we can learn to implement these characteristics in our own life.</p>
<p><strong>Talk Less</strong></p>
<p>We do not command respect by excessively talking. The oft repeated saying &#8216;actions speak louder than words&#8217; is very applicable here. If we do the right thing and become the right person, we do not to justify our actions with words. Talking less does not mean that we ignore the power of the spoken word; it means that we speak when necessary. Don&#8217;t get worked up by every small incident; intervene only on important events. If we are judicious in speaking people will give more importance to our words. If we speak loudly on every minor issue, people will just start to swtich off.</p>
<blockquote><p>True words aren&#8217;t eloquent;<br />
eloquent words aren&#8217;t true.<br />
Wise men don&#8217;t need to prove their point;<br />
men who need to prove their point aren&#8217;t wise.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Lao Tzu.Tao Te Ching Verse 81</p>
<p><strong>Listen More</strong></p>
<p>Everyone likes to have their own say. If we can patiently listen to others they will appreciate our concern and attention. Even if it is a little boring and repetitive, there is no harm in listening to what others have to say; listening to others shows that we are interested in them as a person. Listening more is the perfect complement to talking less. When we talk we try to influence others, when we listen we appreciate others; it is important to get the right balance.</p>
<p><strong>Sincere Appreciation</strong></p>
<p>There is a big difference between sincere appreciation, and flattery which hopes for similar words to be repaid in kind. Take the time to look for people and actions which really deserve appreciation and be generous in offering it to others. It is also important to be judicious in offering praise to others; if we do it all the time it starts to become insincere.</p>
<p><strong> Non Judgemental</strong></p>
<p>It is easy to build up lists of people we like and people we dislike. Our mind gets drawn to the faults of others, but if we are always picking up on the limitations and faults of others, it will diminish our own standing. To be non judgemental and accepting of others is a very powerful trait to develop. In society there can be a certain peer pressure to join in criticising others; there is a peer pressure to accept the gossip of the world. However, if we can be detached and non judgemental people will subconsciously respect our attitude a lot. To be really non judgemental, we should not even start criticising people who started the gossip. Our attitude can be &#8211; We have enough problems to deal with ourselves, without worrying about the failings of other people.</p>

<p>Sometimes we go through periods in life when our body just doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to keep pace with all the things we want to squeeze out of life. I have been going through just such a period lately, and I thought I&#8217;d share with you some of the tips which really helped me in the last while.</p>
<p><strong>1. Don&#8217;t be hard on yourself</strong></p>
<p>Often we go experience a period of acute frustration and unhappiness because our level of output is failing to match our expectations. The phrase &#8216;beating yourself up&#8217; is an extremely apt one here &#8211; the resulting annoyance only compounds the problem by robbing us even further of energy. The important thing here is to stop this train of thought, and start by acknowledging the conditions you find yourself in. In a game of poker, there is no point in cursing the fact that you didn&#8217;t get a royal flush &#8211;  you play with the cards you are dealt. So it is with life. Being determined to deal with this trough of low energy as best and as cheerfully as you can is definitely half the battle to climbing your way clear of it.<span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">2. Observe your surroundings</span></p>
<p>It could be that something in your environment is causing you to feel more tired than necessary. There are many things that can subtly exert a depressing influence on us &#8211; the food we eat, the continual barrage of upsetting news on Radio or TV, disharmony at work or home. Sometimes these under-the-weather stretches can even be a way of letting you know there is something you have to change. You have to become your own personal scientist and really look at everything you come across to see what little tweaks you can make to make things easier on yourself.  I am often reminded of a story about Mahatma Gandhi &#8211; one day he had a headache. At this time he was living on only five pieces of fruit for nourishment. He tried adding and removing various things to his life, removing other things. Eventually he stopped taking his morning piece of fruit and the headache went away!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">3 Learn to distinguish between lethargy and true need for rest.</span></p>
<p>Why is it that when we oversleep, we wake up feeling more tired than ever? Put simply, our body&#8217;s natural tendency is towards inertia and sleep, and it will often grab a mile if given an inch. It is this feeling of inertia that often stops us from getting out and doing things &#8211; sometimes we feel we are tired now, but when we get out and do something, it&#8217;s a whole different story.But &#8211; and this is is a big but &#8211; it is important to learn when the body is being lethargic and when it genuinely needs rest. If persisting with some activity makes you tired, unhappy and susceptible to negative thinking, then it is a definite signal you are pushing beyond your capacity. Many scientists reckon we sleep more than we need, but there are definitely also times when we need more rest, for example when coping with a transformative experience in our lives. With time, you learn to distinguish between lethargy and genuine need for rest and listen to what your body needs than what it wants.</p>

The worst habit we can have is the inability to make any changes, but continue with a perpetual negative attitude. If we can recognise our own bad habits we can create the necessary steps to making meaningful changes in our life. These are some of our most common bad habits in modern life.</p>
<p><strong>Constantly Busy</strong></p>
<p>Is your life constantly hectic, with a never ending strain on your time and nerves? Do you have time to enjoy the finer things of life? Sometimes, even the most financially successful people find it difficult to create leisure time where we can relax and be at peace. It is always possible to create activity and things to do, but many of these activities are invariably non essential. Modern technology is supposed to help make life easier, not make us constantly busy.  Learn how to let go of things like email addiction &#8211; create time for yourself and your own relaxation. <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/finding-time-for-relaxation/">How to Find Time for Relaxation</a></p>
<p><strong>Getting up Late</strong></p>
<p>The best part of the day is often the morning. Yet, the mind and body can be uncooperative, causing us to sleep in for longer than necessary. It is a shame to waste so many hours. Create good sleeping habits, that help you to get up early in the morning; once you have got used to more hours in the morning you will not want to go back to having more sleep than necessary. <a href="http://www.amiracleaday.com/articles/2008/02/12/8-ways-to-get-better-sleep">8 Ways to get better sleep</a><br />
<strong>Worrying About Money</strong></p>
<p>We cannot avoid financial issues, but we can prevent them from dominating our lives. Sometimes money worries occur because we create ever increasing levels of personal debt. This can be due to unnecessary overspending or poor financial management. Don&#8217;t feel happiness is dependent on levels of consumption; if we avoid overspending and creating debt we can avoid much mental anguish. At the other end of the scale, even people who are financially successful can still give too much priority to money. There is more to life than just earning money; don&#8217;t use every moment of your life to think how you can increase your wealth. Don&#8217;t sacrifice current opportunities and your current happiness just to save money for when you retire. Have a positive attitude to money that doesn&#8217;t allow financial concerns to dominate your life.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our life is frittered away by detail&#8230; Simplify, simplify, simplify! &#8230; Simplicity of life and elevation of purpose.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Henry David Thoreau</p>
<p>It is a good question whether modern society has led to an improvement in living standards. We have an unprecedented level of material prosperity, but often it seems to come at the price of increased complexity and stress. However, there is no reason why we cannot have the best of both worlds; taking advantage of modern technology and enjoying the simplicity of living in the present moment. If you feel life is too stressful and complicated these are some tips to simplify your life.</p>
<p><strong>Give Priority to the essentials of life.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we can allow small problems to escalate and dominate our lives. If we get overcharged a few cents, it is irritating, but don&#8217;t allow it to ruin your day. There will always be small issues to irritate us, the secret is to be able to give them the importance they deserve. The essentials of life is cultivating happiness; if small unimportant things overwhelm us, then we will not be able to enjoy life as it should be.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Worry about Pleasing everyone.</strong></p>
<p>If you try to please everyone, you will undoubtedly fail, plus you will not make yourself happy. Consider what is the right thing to do, rather than what other people expect you to do. Don&#8217;t feel guilty if people are disappointed with how you act and choose. It is not your responsibility to please their unreasonable expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Happiness is not Found is fulfilling All Desires</strong></p>
<p>It is a useful exercise, to write down how many desires and wishes that we have. If we are honest, we will find the list to be very long. Often it involves a hope that other people will behave in a certain way. Alternatively, we think that if we can gain greater financial security all our problems will dissipate. However, fulfilling all our desires is not the way to gain happiness. The fulfillment of all desires is inevitably impossible and creates a sense of frustration because we cannot get what we want. Instead, minimise the list of desires and be content with what we have.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t listen to the fears of the mind.</strong></p>
<p>It is our own mind that can create fears and complications in life. If we give importance to these self generated problems, life will feel complex and troublesome. Furthermore, most worries are based on false fears; simplify your life by suspending disbelief and anxiety. Live in the present moment, leave the problems of tomorrow for another day.</p>
<p><strong>Detachment</strong></p>
<p>Life can feel like a never ending soap opera, there are always problems for us to deal with. Detachment doesn&#8217;t mean aloofness, detachment means we will offer service to others without expectation of reward or expectation of a certain outcome. Don&#8217;t feel personally responsible for other people&#8217;s lives. Do what you think is the right thing, but be detached from the outcome.</p>
