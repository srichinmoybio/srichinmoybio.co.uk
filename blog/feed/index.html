				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/peace-universal-peace-menaka.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-980" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/peace-universal-peace-menaka.jpg" alt="peace-universal-peace-menaka" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Inner peace is the most valuable thing that we can cultivate. Nobody can give us inner peace, at the same time it is only our own thoughts that can rob us of our inner peace. To experience inner peace we don&#8217;t have to retreat to a Himalayan cave; we can experience inner peace right now, exactly where we are. The most important criteria is to value the importance of inner peace. If we really value inner peace, we will work hard to make it a reality.</p>
<p>These are some suggestions for bringing more peace into your mind.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Choose carefully where we spend time.</span></p>
<p>If you are a news addict and spend an hour reading newspapers everyday, our mind will be agitated by the relentless negativity we see in the world. It is true, that we can try to detach from this negativity. But, in practise ,we will make our progress easier if we don&#8217;t spend several hours ruminating over the problems of the world. If you have a spare 15 minutes, don&#8217;t just automatically switch on the TV or surf the internet. Take the opportunity to be still or at least do something positive. The problem is the mind feels insecure unless it has something to occupy it. However, when we really can attain a clear mind we discover it creates a genuine sense of happiness and inner peace.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Control of Thoughts.</span></p>
<p>It is our thoughts that determine our state of mind. If we constantly cherish negative and destructive thoughts, inner peace will always remain a far cry. At all costs, we need to avoid pursuing trains of negative thoughts. This requires practise. &#8211; We cannot attain mastery of our thoughts over night. But, at the same time we always have to remember that we are able to decide which thoughts to follow and which to reject. Never feel you are a helpless victim to your thoughts.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8220;If you have inner peace,<br />
nobody can force you to be a slave to the outer reality.&#8221;<br />
&#8211; Sri Chinmoy [2]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Simplify Your Life</span></p>
<p>Modern life, places great demands on our time. We can feel that we never have enough time to fulfill all our tasks. However, we should seek to minimise these outer demands. Take time to simplify your life; there are many things that we can do without, quite often we add unnecessary responsibilities to our schedule. Do the most significant tasks, one at a time, and enjoy doing them. To experience inner peace, it is essential to avoid cluttering our life with unnecessary activities and worries.</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/the-power-of-simplicity/">Benefits of simplicity</a><br />
<span id="more-32"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Spend time to cultivate inner peace.</span></p>
<p>Every day we spend 8 hours a day to earn money, can we not find time to spend 15 minutes to cultivate inner peace? No matter how much money we earn, it cannot bring us inner peace, but, if we spend 15 minutes on meditation and relaxation techniques inner peace can become a possibility. Meditation does not just mean sitting still for 30 minutes; in meditation we seek to experience a state of consciousness which is flooded with inner peace. To experience this inner peace we cannot allow any thought to enter into our mind. True inner peace occurs when we can transcend the world of thoughts.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8220;You cannot buy peace; you must know how to manufacture it within, in the stillness of your daily practises in meditation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Paramahansa Yogananda [2]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Be immune to Flattery and Criticism</span></p>
<p>If we depend on the opinions and praise of other people, we can never have inner peace. Criticism and flattery are two sides of the same coin. They are both the judgements of others. However, we should not allow ourselves to be affected by either. When we do, we feed the ego. We should learn to have confidence in ourselves. This does not mean we will love ourselves in an egotistical way, it means we value our real self and have belief in the good qualities that are part of everyone.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Be Active selflessly</span></p>
<p>Inner peace does not mean that we have to live a life of a hermit. Inner peace, can be felt amidst dynamic activity. But, this action should be done with selfless motives. When we serve others we forget our sense of self, and it is when we forget our limited self that we can have inner peace.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">7. Avoid Criticising Others</span></p>
<p>If we want inner peace, we should feel that our inner peace depends on the well being of others. If we are indifferent to the feelings of others, then it is impossible to have inner peace for ourselves. What we give out comes back. If you offer a peaceful attitude to others this is what we will see return.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="float-left" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/banks-of-rishikesh.jpg" alt="rishikesh" /></p>
<p>In many of my articles on self improvement, I often suggest meditation can be an invaluable aid to alleviating many of our daily problems. I don&#8217;t look upon meditation just as a problem solver, I meditate because I enjoy the consciousness of meditation. But, if we can gain real peace of mind through meditation, there is no problem that cannot be helped in some way. These a few preliminary steps for learning how to meditate.</p>
<p><strong>1. Location.</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, find a suitable quiet place for meditation. If it is very hard to find somewhere quiet, use some <a href="http://www.radiosrichinmoy.org/meditation_music">meditative music</a> to drown out background sounds. If possible keep a corner of your room reserved just for meditation; this will help build up a meditative vibration in that particular part.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Basics.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to meditate with a straight back. (If you try meditating whilst lying down, you are more likely to fall asleep, than entering into a high state of meditation.)</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t meditate after eating a heavy meal &#8211; you will feel lethargic and sleepy.</li>
<li>If possible shower and wear clean clothes before meditating.</li>
<li>Try to switch off. If you try to meditate straight after work, you may be still thinking about the day. Try reading some books on meditation to help make the transition from work to meditation.</li>
<li>If you have difficulty creating time see:<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/life/finding-time-for-relaxation/"> Finding Time for Relaxation / Meditation</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Relaxation.</strong></p>
<p>To meditate it is important to relax and switch off. Tell yourself that for the next 10-15 minutes, you don&#8217;t have to think about the past or future &#8211; just concentrate on the present moment and your meditation. Let go of any tension in your body and try to be fully aware of the present moment. This stage of relaxation is a preliminary stage to meditation; but, it is worth emphasizing that meditation is more than just relaxation.</p>
<p><span id="more-117"></span></p>
<p><strong>4. Breathing.</strong></p>
<p>The most helpful aid to meditation is proper breathing. Our breathing has a big impact on our mind; if we can quieten our breathing it will help slow down our mind. Focusing on our breathing and nothing else will have a beneficial effect on our meditation. The beauty of meditation is its simplicity. &#8211; Just be fully conscious of your breathing, feel you are breathing in peace; if you can do this without getting distracted you will be able to meditate most effectively.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Calm Mind</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you meditate, what you actually do is to enter into a calm or still, silent mind. We have to be fully aware of the arrival and attack of thoughts. That is to say, we shall not allow any thought, divine or undivine, good or bad, to enter into our mind. Our mind should be absolutely silent. Then we have to go deep within; there we have to observe our real existence. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>With these preliminary stages you can now concentrate on cultivating a calm and quiet mind. This is the essence of meditation, whatever form of meditation you pursue, they will share this common goal of quietening the mind. It is only when we can have a mind free of thoughts that we will be able to experience real meditation. What happens is that we can quieten the mind we can expand our consciousness and bring the soul to the fore. We we feel an expansion of our consciousness; when we have a good feeling towards the world, &#8211; this is real meditation.<br />
<strong><br />
6. What is Good meditation?</strong></p>
<p>We can know we are meditating well when we have a good view towards the world. If we feel tension and disturbance then our meditation is not working well. We should have a feeling of simplicity and humility; if we feel proud with ourselves this is not a good sign. Meditation aims to reduce the ego, not expand it.</p>
<p><strong>7. But Meditation is Difficult</strong></p>
<p>Many newcomers to meditation find it difficult to quieten the mind. This is because the mind is so used to thinking that when we try to stop it is quite a shock to the system. But, if we really want to do something we persevere and practice; meditation is no different, the more we put into meditation the more we will get from it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past decade, I&#8217;ve been competing in cycle races across the UK. In those 10 years, I&#8217;ve finished in just about every position from first to last. As an athlete there is always part of you which is striving to win; but at the same time as trying to win, I&#8217;ve tried to learn the art of being happy and cheerful whatever the outcome (harder in practise than theory.)</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy offers the supreme philosophy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He is the great winner<br />
Who wins.<br />
He is the greater winner<br />
Who is the cheerful loser.<br />
He is the greatest winner<br />
Who gives equal value<br />
To victory and defeat.<br />
He alone is the real loser<br />
Who separates<br />
Defeat from victory.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy (1)</p>
<p>This is a lofty philosophy, and I wouldn&#8217;t say I have been able to manage such a sense of oneness with the winner of races; I still prefer to win! But, it is a potent reminder that there is more to a race than winning. The hardest test for a human is to remain cheerful whatever the outer circumstances. If we can remain happy, despite outer disappointment, that is a great achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Some things I have learnt from 10 years of competing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tejvan-b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1001" alt="tejvan-b" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tejvan-b.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Cheerfulness helps performance</strong>. I remember once hearing Sri Chinmoy tell runners in the <a href="http://3100.srichinmoyraces.org/">3100 Self-Transcendence mile race</a> that if they smile more, they would run faster. I took this lesson to mean that if we can be cheerful and remember to smile, it can help us to be in a better frame of mind, and when we are in a better consciousness we can do better. Cheerfulness helps many aspects of performance. When we get angry and disappointed with ourselves, the opposite happens, we can lose our determination, confidence and enthusiasm. Maintaining cheerfulness helps us to be positive and determined. More subtly, a cheerful attitude helps us to get into that elusive &#8216;flow&#8217; of good energy.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with disappointment</strong>. There isn&#8217;t any athlete who hasn&#8217;t been disappointed with their performance at some time of their career, if not every year. We are striving to do better and make improvements, but the body doesn&#8217;t respond in the way that we hope and expect. From a practical point of view it is important to be realistic and remember, this is an inevitability of life and physical performance. It may be a bit of cliché, but we never make progress in a straight line, it is more like a corkscrew, sometimes we have to go down as well as up. Remembering this inevitability, helps to prevent needless introspection and loss of motivation. Another cliché, often rolled out &#8211; is the fact that defeats are just as important as the victories. It maybe clichéd, but it is also true. With disappointing results, firstly we have to keep things in perspective; this creates a sense of detachment and balance which helps us to move on.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy the experience.</strong> The joy of winning is fleeting at best. You get to lift a trophy and a moment&#8217;s fame, but this joy is transient. A much better approach to sport is to try and enjoy every aspect of training, and racing. In one sense, racing on the limit is physically painful, but it gives a sense of satisfaction that you can&#8217;t get from sitting on a comfortable sofa. If we can remember to enjoy the exhilaration of performance and competing, we will get a much more lasting sense of fulfilment, that isn&#8217;t reliant on winning. Sri Chinmoy once said something like a marathon is torture for the body, mind and vital, but joy for the heart (unofficial quote from my memory)  I think all athletes can relate to the paradox of physical and mental pain, but at the same time getting some kind of joy from the whole experience.</p>
<p><strong>Self-transcendence</strong>. Self-transcendence is simply our effort to better ourselves. This can be on any level &#8211; physical, mental and spiritual. We may not have the greatest natural talent, but we can always try to beat our previous bests or the best for our age category. Self transcendence means we are not comparing ourselves with others, but competing with ourself. From a practical point of view, it is very beneficial to only concentrate on your own performance and not think about other athletes. When you start wondering what your competitors are doing, you will lose focus. We cannot always transcend our physical capacities, but even if our time is disappointing, we can still try and transcend our approach to victory.</p>
<p><strong>Detachment.</strong> Related to self-transcendence and the goal of competing with ourselves, we need to cultivate the capacity to have detachment from the result. Detachment doesn&#8217;t mean not caring. It just means we try to maintain equanimity whatever the outcome. Rather than seeing ourselves as a failure or success, we can just focus on what we achieved. As long as we have given everything, then we should seek satisfaction from that, and not the outer result.</p>
<p><strong>The past is dust</strong>. Another great mantra, is &#8216;The Past is Dust&#8217; Perhaps one performance or one season was disappointing. If we dwell on this, we bring a lot of negativity into our mind and this will only adversely affect our future performance. It is always better to concentrate on doing what we can at this present time, and just let go of any unfortunate experience. Just take a very practical approach, whatever position we are in, what is the best thing we can do from this situation? <span id="more-1000"></span></p>
<p><strong>Aiming for perfection.</strong> When I started competing I had a rather relaxed attitude. On the day of racing, I&#8217;d be trying to do a couple of other things I thought were important. I&#8217;d turn up to the race and perhaps a bit of equipment would be missing, I&#8217;d be a bit late or my preparation wouldn&#8217;t be ideal. There is nothing particularly wrong with this. But, there is a much better way of competing. I now try to see the race as some kind of spiritual discipline. On race day, I see the race as the most important thing, and don&#8217;t try to multi-task. It is much more relaxing and energising when we give ourselves time to make all the necessary preparations. Making sure our equipment is 100% in working order, looking the part. This might only make a marginal outcome on the result, but the change of attitude is very important. By giving the training and racing 100% focus, we can have a very different experience to just trying to fit it in amongst other things. I remember when preparing for a big race, one cycling coach said something like it was time &#8216;to be ruthlessly focused&#8217; This advice  jumped up at me, and I took it to heart. For that race, I decided to leave no stone unturned.</p>
<p><strong>Attitude in a race</strong>. Before a race, I try to meditate. I usually meditate twice a day, but I feel it also helpful for racing because it focuses the mind. In meditation, we try to get rid of thoughts and bring our inner will to the fore. Then as you go and do the race, you try to continue this meditative approach. When you&#8217;re racing, you don&#8217;t want to be thinking of how you are unprepared or something like that. You want to be completely focused on the effort of the race. I try to get into that zone, where it feels there are no mental barriers to getting out your best performance. One of the highlights of racing, is when you feel you get beyond that thinking level and feel you&#8217;re just on the limit and everything is combining to get the best effort. From one sense racing at the limit is great physical pain, but there is also a freedom from the usual mental drudgery; you are really living life on the edge. It becomes hard to explain, but it can be a great experience. This is something to try and feel grateful for.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Each negative thought<br />
Has the atom-bomb-capacity<br />
To destroy our whole world.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p>To overcome negativity in ourself, in other people, there are many things we can do.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/happy-do-you-want-pavitrata.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-934" alt="negativitiy-poem" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/happy-do-you-want-pavitrata.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t cherish negativity</strong></p>
<p>Often we unconsciously cherish negativity. We get a subtle temptation to enjoy gossip and complain. This may start off as an innocent joke, but it can grow and we become more and more negative because we focus on it. Sometimes, we need to be aware that negativity is a trait we can consciously hold onto. If we first become aware, we can change.</p>
<p><strong>The mind is like blotting paper</strong></p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna once observed that the human mind is like blotting paper &#8211; it absorbs whatever it is dipped into. If we surround ourselves with a negative environment, then this will seep into us. For example, if you find yourself reading newspaper comments section, internet forums, you expose yourself to vast quantities of negativity. This seeps into your mind, and you start subconsciously picking up on all the negativity yourself. It&#8217;s impossible not to be affected to some extent. However,  if you spend time in a very different environment, where there is a positive energy, you will definitely feel the difference &#8211; enabling you to feel positive about yourself and the world.</p>
<p><strong>Get out of ruts</strong></p>
<p>Negativity is often the result of getting stuck in a rut &#8211; getting stuck in a bad habit. If we have the same routine, the mind gets into a rhythm of complaining. Sometimes, we need to work hard to get out of a rut. Do something out of the ordinary, and break your old habits. This breaks the cycle of negativity and gives a sense of newness. In this newness, you can much more easily get out of your negativity.</p>
<p><strong>But, the problem is other people….</strong></p>
<p>If you feel that the problem is always other people, you can be assured it isn&#8217;t. It is true, we need to avoid unnecessarily negative situations. But, ultimately, we have to be aware it is only ourself who can choose to be negative or positive. Other people will always have failings, limitations and degrees of negativity. But, that is not an excuse for us to accept their negativity. Just because other people are enjoying negativity, doesn&#8217;t mean we have to.<span id="more-995"></span></p>
<h3>Staying positive in a sea of negativity.</h3>
<p>In theory, it&#8217;s easy to say &#8216;stay positive and cheerful&#8217; &#8211; whatever other people do. But, in practise, it can be a little more difficult! What practical steps can we take?</p>
<ul>
<li>Always create time for yourself. For example, a <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/meditation/basic-steps-for-learning-meditation/">daily meditation</a> routine. This is the chance to invoke peace and inner happiness. In these moments, remind yourself, you can always choose to be grateful for the opportunity for inner happiness. Just the act of reminding yourself of what you want will give you some reserves to reject the negativity, you will face later in the day.</li>
<li>Let things flow. A real secret of life is learning to let things go. Don&#8217;t magnify small problems. Feel like negativity is impermanent, and can wash away. Don&#8217;t dwell on negativity, spending energy complaining about others negativity &#8211; then there will be no end. Just see it is a fleeting, passing emotion you can let go. Instead, concentrate on enjoying the positive, something in the present moment.</li>
<li>Invoke the positive. It may sound a little trite to say, the secret of avoiding negativity is to concentrate on the opposite. But, it is still true. In stagnation, negativity will become stronger. With a sense of dynamism, and positive energy, negativity gets dissipated. This is the most effective way. Don&#8217;t fight negativity, just ignore it by welcoming the opposite.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Positive feelings<br />
Can compel negative thoughts<br />
To starve.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy [2]</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember the good qualities of people. The easiest thing is to fixate on the mistake and weaknesses of other people. If you observe someone&#8217;s fault, also insist that you remember something very good about them. This is an excellent practice for avoiding a negative spiral.</li>
<li>Be grateful it&#8217;s not any worse. Sometimes we get annoyed over really trivial things. We may have to wait in a queue, we have to clean up some mess, but we can still remind ourselves of all the things to be grateful for. Spending a few minutes over a minor inconvenience is not such a problem compared to the difficulties other people face.</li>
<li>Change the conversation. Many people will bring up some complaint or negativity in conversation. It is up to us how we respond. It is easy to join in the self-righteous indignation and negativity. But, also we can bring up a completely different topic, which invokes a positive energy. If someone is in a negative frame of mind, there is always going to be something they can be cheerful about that. Ignore their negative chain of thought. Instead mention an achievement they have recently done or inspiring piece of news. Here you are forcing them to forget about their negativity. If you can help others to escape negativity, you will definitely see a great change in your own consciousness. The important thing is you don&#8217;t directly challenge someone &#8211; &#8216;stop being negative&#8217; doesn&#8217;t work so well. But, mention their achievements, and they will become positive (mostly anyway!). When they are in a good frame of mind, it is then a better energy to deal with their area of concern or negativity.</li>
<li>Be a problem solver. It is very easy to list the reasons to be negative. It is very easy to find fault. But, negativity never solves any problem. If a situation looks bleak, what is the best way forward? No matter how bad things may appear, there is always a way to make gradual progress and ameliorate the situation. This is the secret of successful and courageous people. Whatever the situation take a calm look at the best thing you can do. If you trying to improve a very difficult situation, this positive effort is a reason for you to be positive &#8211; no matter how bad the external situation is.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t expect. Sometimes we are negative because we have unreasonable expectations. When these expectations aren&#8217;t fulfilled we become negative. Avoid preconceptions and it is easy to avoid negativity for failed expectation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real happiness and genuine spiritual progress requires an ability and willingness to be honest with ourselves. We could call it self-criticism, but I prefer honesty. If we can be honest about our motives and actions, we will learn to cultivate a more self-giving attitude and keep our ego in check.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/every-day-only-one-thing-honestly-happy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-992" title="every-day-only-one-thing-honestly-happy-menaka-photo" alt="every-day-only-one-thing-honestly-happy-menaka-photo" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/every-day-only-one-thing-honestly-happy.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This self-awareness and personal honesty, doesn&#8217;t mean we have to be overly critical of ourselves. We are not trying to make ourselves feel guilty; it is not about confessing sins, but a willingness to understand our true motivations and be aware of our shortcomings. If we always live with an attitude of self-justification and feel we are always right, we will struggle to make any real progress and will be more prone to pride and insecurity. But, if we can be honest and aware of our shortcomings, we can become the person we really want to. It may be a little hard work, but it will pay off in the long run!</p>
<p>These are some exercises we can take to make sure we are not living in a bubble.</p>
<p><strong>1. Motive.</strong> Before undertaking an action what is the motive behind it? If we are undertaking an action, why are we doing it? Would we still do it if nobody was aware of it? It is not wrong to welcome appreciation of others. But, if our action is only motivated by the desire to please others or show off, then we are only feeding our ego and it can cause problems. A pure motive helps us to transcend the ego and we gain satisfaction from extending our sense of oneness.</p>
<p><strong>2. Criticism?</strong> Do we put other people down to make us feel better? There is a part of us that tries to bolster our self-esteem by feeling better than others. This can make us critical of other people. We may not even be aware we are doing this, unless we can be really honest about our motives. Instead, we should feel our self-esteem can be built by encouraging and being sympathetic to others. It means avoiding the temptation to jump onto a train of gossip. It means we need to cultivate more self-belief and self-confidence.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do we spend too much time making excuses?</strong></p>
<p>It is human nature to try and blame our misfortune on other people and outer circumstances. But, shifting the blame onto other people is often a clever way of hiding our own shortcomings. Sometimes we think that only if we can move away from people who make life difficult for us, everything will be OK. But, when we do move somewhere else, we find the same problems are just as prominent. This is because the weakness is stemming from ourselves. We only see the our limitations reflected in other people.</p>
<dl>
<dt style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The only devils in this world are those running around in our own hearts, and that is where all our battles should be fought.&#8221;</dt>
<dt>- Mahatma Gandhi</dt>
</dl>
<p>If we are prone to anger, we can always blame the situation and the actual trigger for our anger. But, this will never deal with the underlying problem. Instead, we should make a conscious decision to overcome anger, and bring peace into our system. Here honesty is helping us to become aware of our shortcomings and helps us to realise that it is up to us to decide what will causes us to lose our inner peace. <span id="more-991"></span></p>
<p><strong>4. Do we seek flattery / sympathy?</strong> Are we looking for sympathy / praise? Sometimes we go &#8216;fishing&#8217; for sympathy or praise.  If we subconsciously seek sympathy, this can encourage a sense of self-pity and weakness. If we have misfortune, is part of us enjoying the sympathy we get? We have to keep asking ourselves, are we trying our hardest to create a positive outcome?</p>
<p><strong>5. False modesty.</strong> Do we make a big show of trying to prove our humility and modesty? Humility does not mean making ourselves invisible, humility means accepting with good grace what life puts on our plate. Sometimes, when we try to be humble, it is a false humility, and really it is our ego that is seeking reassurance. Real modesty and humility means we try to maintain an attitude of gratitude for whatever role we need to play on life&#8217;s stage.</p>
<p>There is a fine line between genuine self-awareness and being too harsh on ourselves. But, honesty and a mindfulness of our state of being</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We often cherish insecurity without being fully aware of it. Insecurity about what people think of us is quite common and it can lead to unnecessary problems. When we are insecure, it tends to make us more suspicious, it makes us try harder to impress. Because we are insecure about ourselves, we lose the self-confidence to be true to our real nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/beach-jowan.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-988" alt="beach-jowan" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/beach-jowan.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">A oneness-heart<br />
Cures<br />
Insecurity-fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<p>These are some steps to overcoming insecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Recognise the problem and make an effort to overcome</strong></p>
<p>The first thing is that people may not realise a lot of their anxieties, worries and fears stem from a sense of insecurity about ourselves. We worry because we are insecure about our standing in society and amongst friends. When we are aware of a misplaced insecurity, it becomes much easier to try and overcome it. This requires an awareness and honesty about our motivations and actions.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t be overly critical of other people.</strong></p>
<p>If you spend time criticising and judging other people, you will subconsciously fear the same treatment yourself. Invariably highly critical people have a deep seated insecurity themselves. The motivation to criticise comes from a need to make themselves feel superior to other people. However, the attempt to make yourself feel better by putting other people down will never work. At best, we get a temporary false sense of security, but it never lasts. If we want to create a genuine sense of self-belief and self-confidence, never base it on being superior to others. In fact it is the opposite, if we can have a sympathetic and empathetic attitude, we will feel better ourselves. <span id="more-987"></span></p>
<p><strong>People think about you much less than you imagine.</strong></p>
<p>We often feel that people are constantly thinking about us. We worry what they might be saying. But, often people think about us much less than we imagine. Even if people do gossip, it doesn&#8217;t mean much and it will soon pass. If you are the subject of gossip, look upon it as a tiny insect crawling over an elephant. The elephant remains unmoved and the insect soon gives up trying to bother the elephant.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t dwell on mistakes</strong></p>
<p>We all make mistakes and errors of judgement. But, if we focus on this too much, it can magnify the problem and we will just develop more insecurity. Guilt is especially a damaging emotion because we feel bad. Guilt makes us seek redemption and people&#8217;s approval. But, it is better just to let go misplaced feelings of guilt. The best way to move on from past mistakes, is simply to be active and dynamic. If we brood over the past, our insecurity will never end. But, if we can take even a small positive step, our self-confidence will improve.</p>
<p><strong>Concentrate on the opposite</strong></p>
<p>If we are prone to insecurity, take the time to concentrate on the opposite. Remember our good qualities. If we can cherish a few positive thoughts, it is the best and most effective way to wash away some of our insecurities. Rather than fight, just embrace the alternative.</p>
<p><strong>The heart unites, the mind divides</strong></p>
<p>The mind divides us from other people. It is the mind and our ego which constantly play the game of superiority and inferiority. However, if we bring the qualities of the heart forward, we can develop a sense of oneness with other people. We won&#8217;t feel insecure when we feel a kinship with other people.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to be detached about judgement</strong></p>
<p>Everyone gets judged by all and sundry. Sometimes it may have a degree of truth, sometimes not. It is important to be detached and let this judgement go. It doesn&#8217;t affect who we are, but if we keeping thinking about adverse judgements, it can bind us and make us feel inadequate. When we learn to be detached, we will feel more secure about ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t feel the need to explain or defend yourself.</strong></p>
<p>A good practise to overcome insecurity, is making a point of not feeling the need to explain or defend yourself. Insecurity is really a form of pride in disguise. If we let got of our pride, we don&#8217;t have any reason to be insecure. Also, if you have done something good, avoid the temptation to tell everybody about it. Invariably people will find out anyway. But, it is much better to have the confidence to concentrate on doing the good things without the need for approval. This will lessen our insecurity because we are basing our satisfaction on the intrinsic act rather than waiting for flattery.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, we get caught out by the simplicity of life. Our mind, which tend to prefer complexity, forgets that the simplest of things can make a big difference to our state of mind and happiness. Why is it so important to smile?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/smiling-people-vietnam-unmesh.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="smiling-people-vietnam-unmesh" alt="smiling people" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/smiling-people-vietnam-unmesh.jpg" width="500" height="378" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Choosing happiness</strong></p>
<p>Life throws many things at us &#8211; both good and bad. But, if we can respond by offering an outer smile, we are trying to respond in a positive way. Our smile is our conscious decision to try and remain happy, whatever the circumstance. From this initial positive choice, we can build upon this beginning to cultivate happiness. If we refuse to smile, we are more likely to cultivate emotions of self-pity, wounded pride and unhappiness. If we have difficulty cultivating happiness, then trying to smile at the world and our mind, is a positive step we can take.</p>
<p><strong>Offering something positive</strong></p>
<p>If we can sincerely smile at others, we can give something without even speaking.  When we smile, we are offering our good will to the world and other people. We don&#8217;t need to be a millionaire to give something to the world, in many circumstances, a soulful smile can be more beneficial than any amount of words or material aid. To make the effort to smile at a stranger or friend, is to sympathise with their plight and offer some encouragement.</p>
<p><strong>We disarm our enemies</strong></p>
<p>Our face can reflect the emotion and thoughts that we wish to share. If we wish to make enemies, we can scowl and look miserable. But, if we smile at anyone, it can create an atmosphere of goodwill and harmony. By smiling, we create a climate where others can feel more at ease. When people feel happier, they will be more inclined to be tolerant and open-minded. If we smile and put others in a good frame of mine, we will be more likely to get what we want.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to smile at your enemies &#8211; You can take the motivation from the wit of Oscar Wilde:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much.”</p>
<p>Or we can take the more spiritual approach of Abraham Lincoln:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="more-983"></span></p>
<p>When we smile at other people, it is an inner statement, that we hold nothing against them. If we hold onto resentments, we are caught by this negative train of thoughts and emotions. If we smile, we free ourselves from this emotional tangle. To sincerely smile, is to offer silent forgiveness, and most importantly give ourselves inner freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Peace of mind</strong></p>
<p>In the spiritual life, it is said there are no instant quick fixes for spiritual transformation. But, if we smile we can considerable reduce the tension of the mind; it is cheap and quick. When we smile at our searing problems, it reminds us that we are not indispensable, it reminds us our problems are not the ultimate reality. It gives us that detachment; it is a feint reminder that we still have an inner reserve of happiness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Smile, smile, smile<br />
At your mind<br />
As often as possible.<br />
Your smiling will considerably reduce<br />
Your mind&#8217;s tearing tension.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy, [1]</p>
<p><strong>Smiling reminds us no matter how bad things are, they could have been worse.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Smile at the world.<br />
Smile at yourself.<br />
Just smile, within and without!<br />
Your fate could have been<br />
Infinitely worse.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy [2]</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When giving meditation classes, a common issue is people find it difficult to find the time to set aside 15 minutes of the day for meditation and a period of quiet reflection. We all know it would be good to meditate, but to actually make sure we do it can be quite a challenge. Similarly, we can have the best of intentions to change some of our bad habits and wrong attitudes, but we think maybe it will be easier or better at a later stage. For any progressive change in our nature or worthwhile practise, the best time to start is always now!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Pink-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-975" alt="Pink-pic" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Pink-pic.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We might think there will be a better time in the future, but in the spiritual life, the best time is always this present moment. If we wait for outer circumstances to be more favourable, we will always be delaying and procrastinating. And before we know it, we will have given up completely.</p>
<p>These are some tips to value the present moment and take each opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Valuing meditation</strong></p>
<p>The first thing is we need to always remember the value of meditation and spiritual practise. If we see meditation as some hard discipline we need to endure, our mind will always find an excuse to avoid doing it. However, if we can focus on the benefits and joy that we will get from the practise, we will always be motivated to keep trying. Here we need to use our wisdom, we need to convince our mind that we get more joy from meditation than we would wasting our time on some inconsequential other activity. Don&#8217;t feel when we meditate we are making a great sacrifice. Our reward will not be in heaven, it will be from cultivating a genuine sense of happiness here and now.</p>
<p><strong>Change attitude to difficulties</strong></p>
<p>If we wish to start a practise of meditation, there will be innumerable obstacles. For example, we may find it is much noiser than we like. One option is to say, &#8216;it&#8217;s too noisy&#8217; let&#8217;s wait until its quieter. The other option is to say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take this outer noise as a part of the meditation practise. I shall try incorporate the noise into the meditation &#8211; learning to allow the sound to wash away.&#8221; If we can meditate with noise, it will make our meditation practise much stronger. It&#8217;s like a runner training on hilly terrain. When he finally reaches the flat terrain, the challenging hills made him stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to say no!</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, other people can take advantage of our good nature and encourage us to take on more jobs and responsibility. But, we have to learn to say no, and put our spiritual practise first. If we can lose our feeling of indispensability, we find the world doesn&#8217;t end, just because we spend 20 minutes early in the morning learning to meditate.</p>
<p><strong>Live as if it was your last day on earth</strong></p>
<p>If it was your last day on earth, how would you spend it? Would you really worry about paying some telephone bill? Would you waste it in meaningless gossip and chat? If it was our last day, we would concentrate on the important things in  life. We would suddenly be very clear what is important to us. Material possessions lose all meaning &#8211; they are merely passing things; but our inner practise, our inner faith and inner peace become all important.</p>
<p><strong>If we don&#8217;t take this opportunity, we won&#8217;t have it again</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div id="text-10">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A spiritual life means:<br />
It is now<br />
Or never.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sri Chinmoy (1)</p>
<p>Every moment is an opportunity &#8211; either we take it or lose it. In one sense, we have eternity to achieve realisation. But, if this is our laid back attitude, we will progress with the speed of an Indian bullock cart. If we get an opportunity to meditate or change our attitude &#8211; then we should take it now, whilst we have the aspiration. If we miss out, perhaps in a few days, we will lose any enthusiasm or willingness to change.</p>
<p><span id="more-974"></span></p>
<p><strong>If something is good to do, why delay?</strong></p>
<p>Suppose we have a problematic relationship. Perhaps it is partly our mistake / our fault. Quite often our pride resists letting the situation to be resolved. Rather than be willing to let go and forgive, we hold onto a grievance or sense of injustice. This can not only prolong the problem, but can even magnify it out of proportion. But, it is only we who will suffer. If we can see a way to resolve the conflict &#8211; now is the best time. If we do the right thing now, it will prevent the continuation of negative thoughts and negative emotions.</p>
<p><strong>Feed enthusiasm</strong></p>
<p>In the spiritual life, enthusiasm is a great quality. It is infectious and can help overcome many obstacles. When there is a forward dynamic movement, when we feel fully committed to making something happen, we have that intensity and focus to overcome all obstacles. However, if we are hesitant, the initial burst of energy is dissipated, we allow doubt and insecurity to enter. Before we now it, we have found reasons not to do something. We have found reasons to delay.</p>

<p>This is an inspiring story about the power of forgiveness and compassion. It shows that sometimes we can get extraordinary results by going against our instinctive human nature. The story also shows that forgiveness is a sign of real strength and can have tremendous power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sunrise.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-969" title="sunrise" alt="Sunrise" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sunrise.jpg" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>The story is from <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/illumination-experiences-on-indian-soil-2"><em>Illumination-Experiences On Indian Soil, Part 2</em></a>, by Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>&#8220;In India there was once a Muslim mendicant who had a certain amount of occult power. His name was Bajit Bastami. In Chittagong there is a special place where many Muslims worship him. Even the Hindus have tremendous love for him.</p>
<p><span id="more-967"></span></p>
<p>In a pond near his tomb there are fifteen or twenty very large turtles that were actually human beings once upon a time. Bajit Bastami got angry at these people because they were unkind to him, so he turned them into turtles. He gave them all names: Rajali, Majali, Pulali and so on. He said that when the time came, he would turn them into human beings once again &#8211; not ordinary human beings, but great human beings. Because they were going through such severe punishment, he said that some time in the future his compassion would help them become great human beings.</p>
<p>There are many stories about Bajit Bastami&#8217;s compassion. Once at midnight he was walking along the street praying and meditating when he saw a man playing on a flute. The flutist was heavily drunk, but he was playing extremely well. Since he was playing such melodious, haunting tunes, people had gathered around him. But whenever they appreciated him, he would insult them, using very foul language. Some people cursed him and left, while others, in spite of being scolded and insulted, stayed there. They didn&#8217;t take his insults seriously, since he was obviously drunk. Besides, the man was playing very well, and they were enjoying the fun.</p>
<p>As soon as the musician saw Bajit, he started insulting him, and this time he used the filthiest, absolutely the most foul tongue. Bajit was annoyed and said, &#8220;You stop using these kinds of words!&#8221;</p>
<p>The drunk flutist got furious. He approached Bajit and struck him mercilessly on the forehead with his flute. The drunkard&#8217;s flute broke and Bajit went home with his forehead bleeding profusely.</p>
<p>By that time Bajit had many, many disciples and followers, and when they saw their Master&#8217;s plight, they wanted to kill this flutist. But Bajit said, &#8220;No, no! You must not do that. Tomorrow morning I will do something about it.&#8221; The disciples were very happy that their Master was going to punish the man.</p>
<p>The following morning Bajit gave one of his servants some most delicious Indian sweets plus a few rupees to take to this flutist, along with a message. The message was that Bajit was extremely sorry that his head was responsible for breaking the man&#8217;s flute, and he was sending money so that the musician could buy a new one. Also, since he had experienced a little bit of the man&#8217;s foul tongue the previous day, he was sending some sweets to sweeten his tongue.</p>
<p>When the flutist received the gifts and heard the message, he was deeply moved. Immediately the musician and all his friends and admirers ran to Bajit &#8216;s cottage and fell at his feet, asking to be illumined by his forgiveness.</p>
<p>In later years they all became Bajit &#8216;s extremely good disciples. In this way, through his compassion Bajit transformed some undivine drunkards into divine aspirants.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<p>The story offers a great lesson that if we want to change someone else&#8217;s nature we could try to lead by example and bring only their good qualities forward. If we get angry, upset or even judgemental, we can harden the attitude of other people. But, if we act like a saint, we can bring the heart of the other person forward.</p>
<p>Oscar Wilde once said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Forgive your enemies, nothing annoys them so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, if our forgiveness is out of real sense of oneness, if our forgiveness is motivated by a sense to bring the best nature of our enemy forward, it is an opportunity for them to break a cycle of bad behaviour. Our enemies become grateful to our magnaminity. Abraham Lincoln offered this illumining thought:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?”</p>
<p>In this case, the saint destroyed the cycle of anger and judgement. In its place, he gave the drunk the opportunity to bring his better nature to the fore. In this case, we see that real forgiveness brought illumination. Sri Chinmoy offers two significant poems on this theme.</p>
