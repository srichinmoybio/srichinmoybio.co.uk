		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking about a lot of this stuff lately, I think on the last point on Conclusions about reminding ourselves that early conclusions are likely to be wrong; They are or may be just that but if the mind see&#039;s it and stops because they are wrong and tries to think about it as a problem then this would be counter productive, if the mind see&#039;s it as a silly conclusion or unnecessary and keeps going (keeping awareness on wondering about this thing) then i find, myself, i can nearly straight away come up with an ah-ha moment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanx for sharing such a great insight..  I&#039;m gaining spirituality and pschyic under guidance. I&#039;ve travelled across globe to find the very purpose of life. Even i&#039;ve found the same problem regarding to it. We as an individual have an irrational approach to conclusion and hence we jump over to conclusion which often heads us to negative notion. And the main reason behind this is &quot;black and white thinking&quot; and so often we kill our own thoughts. Before we could even realise what we have done, it was too late to make a backtrak. When i have been asked how one can stop approaching irrational thinking is stop thinking, the mind has a common tendency to work for you but inbetween it does&#039;t notice what it is doing for you. So stop waving with your mind and order it to work for you. Whenever i asked my client to make a thought matrix, they make it in such a way that they want to be happy in every second. They just went for white rather black thinking. Though it is not wrong to be ever happy but this is the very reason behind irrational approach to jump over conclusion and it makes the thing worst b&#039;cause mind starts solving the very problem and then outcome would be your&#039;s next problem over problems. And this has no end except a dead end. I would like to quote, the legend David Bohm, over complication by thought, i.e. &quot;thought is constantly creating problems that way and then trying to solve them, but as it tries to solve them it makes it worse b&#039;cause it doesn&#039;t notice that it&#039;s creating them and the moqe it thinks, the more problems it creates&quot;. If we would take it as pschyic field of energy. Our thought speaks to subconcious mind of many others and this way we draw what we speak to this subconcious field.
So think good and leave the rest.  

In love and light, 

God bless you .

		<description><![CDATA[I love this! 

What really reasonates for me is &quot;How would you like the other people to think or behave in the similar situation.  

This really helps me look at my limiting thought and clears it away, as it&#039;s not really the truth and i can change the negative thought to a better feeling thought.  

Another question I ask myself before entering into a sensitive conversation with someone else is:  What are my thoughts and expectations on the outcome? If its not positive then I don&#039;t consider it my business and I don&#039;t approach the topic.  

Helps me when I question if something is my business or something that&#039;s not.  

Love your posts, keep up the inspiration!

		<description><![CDATA[The whole &#039;black or white&#039; issue really resonates with me. I&#039;ve been challenged over the last year with having a corporate job, and wanting to be pursuing my heart-based business endeavors (websites, writing, blogs, etc).

One of my spiritual teachers said to me, &quot;Instead of thinking of yourself as between both worlds... as in not a part of either one... consider the possibility that you have one foot in each.&quot;

That was really helpful to me.

Lately, I&#039;ve been really having a lot of fun with observing my language patterns in this regard.

For example, it&#039;s a real challenge to replace &quot;but&quot; with &quot;and.&quot; When I do this, though, I notice a great sense of empowerment!

By shifting to an &quot;and&quot; mindset, we move ourselves away from doubt, fear, and inadequacy, and instead shift into possibility, excitement, empowerment, and opportunity.
