		<description><![CDATA[I somehow agree and disagree with you perhaps.

 Nevertheless I like your post. I do not push positive thinking when it&#039;s just idealism with wonderful promises. 
I like p.t. when it&#039;s a fruit of, for example: &#039;true spiritual richness&#039; and it&#039;s opposite: &#039;true spiritual poverty&#039;.

Wish you well !]]></description>
