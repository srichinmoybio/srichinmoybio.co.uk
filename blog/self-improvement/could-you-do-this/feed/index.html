		<description><![CDATA[For the last one week, i have been asking am i that bad, i always want to deny the criticsm that my lecturer did on me. I always want to believe that the criticsm is not true at all. I am so glad and fortunate to come across this artice at the time i need it most.I felt so touched when i read your article and almost wanted to cry. I then realise What my lecturer said is true.&quot;Even if criticism is offered with unkind words, it can still contain very good advice which can help us improve. &quot;This sentence penetrate deep inside my heart. For all this while, i always &quot;hate&quot;when people praise me, as i believe that they just want to boost me,and nothing true about what they say. Now, i guess it is ok, not to accept praise but Not criticsm. Thank you for the well written article. i always wish that one day i would be able to speak my mind as clear as you had done.I do feel grateful for the critiscm as i know,now, i need to work harder to improve myself and for that i owe you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Finally I have found this Website. Wow. Sometimes I feel like a corn of rice poped up and then reduced to a grain of sand but definitely everything helps me in terms of finishing the self-perfection-journey. I am so grateful to be 
a member of the inspiration-group. It widens your receptivity. We see that others tell what for so long was untold specially this sentence: Too often we allow certain things to permanently cloud our judgement and opinion of others.

		<description><![CDATA[Good stuff Tejvan!  I especially like the importance you place upon being able to control our thoughts and have a &quot;silent mind&quot;. Sometimes it feels like my mind goes onto overdrive, and that is when I find I need to find a quiet place, be still, and meditate for a few minutes. This is a relatively new thing I do and it has helped a lot!]]></description>
