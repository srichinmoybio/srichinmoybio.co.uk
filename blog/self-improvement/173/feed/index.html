		<description><![CDATA[I have just stumbled upon this blog and have enjoyed what I&#039;ve been reading. I know it is against the spirit of the blog to be pedanticly critical but I have a slight problem with the way &quot;lifestyle&quot; is sometimes used for &quot;life&quot;.

My first thoughts when I hear the longer word is that it reminds me of that jingle on Classic FM - &quot;Classic FM - for your classic lifestyle&quot; (what does that mean?!).

On further reflection it seems another indicator that we are all encouraged to divorce who we are from the way we live; as if they have no relationship to each other.

But there I go; I must do something about my &quot;grumpy old man&quot; lifestyle!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another great 30-day idea is to make a small but notable diet change.  I remember the day when I started drinking Sprite instead of Dr. Pepper.

Then eventually I swapped out Sprite and started drinking more milk, fruit juice, and water.  Eventually I switched to organic milk and fruit juice... I still haven&#039;t found organic water. ;)

Or it can start even simpler.  For those who don&#039;t have fruit as part of their diet, just eat one piece of fruit per day.  Or perhaps one carrot or piece of celery.

Long story short: I think that making small dietary changes really fits well in the 30-day program because while it can be intimidating to say &quot;I&#039;m changing my diet&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m going on a diet,&quot; it&#039;s much easier to say, &quot;I&#039;m going to enjoy something new for the next 30 days.&quot;]]></description>
