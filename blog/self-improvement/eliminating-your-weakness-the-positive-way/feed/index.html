I totally agree, you become what you think and just by changing a few beliefs you will feel much better. We all need hopes and dreams. Postivity can make us feel so much better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Geoff

Thanks for your incisive comments - I think you summed it up perfectly: it is not that we want to engage in Pollyanna head-in-the-clouds thinking, it is just that bringing forward your positive qualities happens to be the most practical route. Thanks again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Shane,

It is without a doubt that thinking about the positive things in our lives makes us not only feel so much better, but we have an improved sense of hope for the future.

It is not that we want to deny that negative things exist, to do so would not be healthy. We just want to deprive those negative of our precious time.

I am glad to have met another person who believes in spreading a message of hope and happiness for the future.
