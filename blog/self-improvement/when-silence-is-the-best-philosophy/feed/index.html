		<description><![CDATA[Life is not a bed of roses. Marriage takes a big deal to happen, sustain and win. Try finding out if your perceptions are real, talk to the person involved. Discuss what are the factors that are refraining him in connecting to you like earlier.
Believe in this:
 &quot;The evil you do remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!&quot;  Do good &amp; Remain Blessed!
So for whatever good you have done, just remember that it gets counted some where else, feel good for what you have done and don&#039;t seek appreciation or gratitude. It will come to you when you are not expecting it. 
Quiting from life, relationship, job is always the last solution and probably easiest of all for the time being. But being in there, working to make it work, waiting to see success all takes immense courage, time and efforts. 
The biggest success of your life is you got married to a person you loved. So feel blessed for that. Count on the blessings and keep the troubles in mind and fight them. Appreciate the other person for what he has done all through the years, you will receive the same.

All the best!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi
silence is the only thing that makes our selves happy. there is English proverb which says: &quot;a parking dog don&#039;t bite&quot;. this means that talkative peole don&#039;t have time to think or at least to preview his mind first before he/she start to print to the others. so silence is the only way that saves your time, dignity, personality and also keeps your relations connected.
  thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[silence is not only the absense of words but also the stillness of mind,its the best way to communicate in aspects of situations where words are never needed to settle down cicumstances.Our mind becomes calmly settled in silence than when we use words to communicate something sensitively. Thank you]]></description>
