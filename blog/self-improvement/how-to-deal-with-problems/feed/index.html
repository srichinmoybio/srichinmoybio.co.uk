		<description><![CDATA[this article is excellent!
William James said &quot;Attitude is more important than facts&quot;.
We as human being can alter our life by alter our attitude towards life.
life will give pain but suffering is optional. 
I believe life without problems has no meaning.
We need to see opportunity in problems and not problems in opportunity.
Thanks!]]></description>
