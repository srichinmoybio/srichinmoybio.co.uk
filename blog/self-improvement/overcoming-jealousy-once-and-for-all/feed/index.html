		<description><![CDATA[You raise some excellent points on jealousy here. I would like to add one more critical attitude that feeds the jealousy monster: Competitiveness. In respect to jealousy, competitiveness works hand in hand with insecurity and builds on the concepts of separation rather than oneness, as the jealous husband is constantly insecure about the status of his relationship, always competeing to keep her for himself against other potential suitors who would steal her away.

When we feel jealousy, we are engaging in a competitive attitude, measuring ourselves against that other person. Our insecurities, as you so rightly pointed out, tell us that in order to obtain the approval of others, we must &quot;out perform&quot; them in some fashion.

The chronic feeling of separation adds to this, causing us to measure the world in terms of who is better/smarter/faster and who is not. Instead, and attitude of oneness permits us to see each others strengths as complements to our own, different strengths. If we can then join our respective skills to a common goal, we stand a better chance of achieving that goal. This is something that cannot happen when jealousy is thrown into the mix.

Good article, Marc]]></description>
