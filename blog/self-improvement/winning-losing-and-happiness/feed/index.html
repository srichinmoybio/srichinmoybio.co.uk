		<description><![CDATA[Fascinating stuff. I can totally relate to this, but I must admit, it can be hard to stay positive 100% of the time. in fact, negativity seems to spiral out of control sometimes if you don&#039;t see it and it can suck you into a more negative mindset and multiply. The good thing is that the opposite is true too, and the brain can be tricked into believing that anything is possible if you have a positive mindset and are seeing evidence that such a mindset works.

I think comparing yourself to others almost always ends up with some kind of negative thought, but looking back at your own progress (or even deterioration) and comparing yourself to yourself can bring about some positivity or remind you of a time when you were more positive and put you back on the right path.]]></description>
