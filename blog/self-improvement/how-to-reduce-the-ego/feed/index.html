		<description><![CDATA[Ah ego..... The part of our psyche that keeps us from being balanced.  I have come to the conclusion that to be truly on the road to self enlightenment one has to identify or at the very least acknowledge we tend to be Ego driven. If the ego is in fact our prideful, selfish, willful ... Dare i say arrogant part of our nature, then the only thing that keeps it in check is our superego. The question that always needs to be asked is how will the action of my ego affect me and others .  Think of a seesaw with ego on one side and superego on the other, neither side should out weigh the other.

		<description><![CDATA[thanks so much for this... I am encouraged to reduce my ego... by watching my mind and the thoughts that pass through it.. catch yourself being egotistic. Watch for example the negativity/assumptions that come, don&#039;t tell yourself off, just watch the thought, and see it dissolve in your mind.
You will be in control of your mind the big promoter of your ego.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My ego is out of control and is bringing me great unhappiness even though I have every reason to be happy. It is time to bite the bullet and do something about it.

I like point 7. Most of my motivations have been to impress others. that is definitely something that I need to work on.]]></description>
