		<description><![CDATA[&quot; Real love does not expect from others, but only gives without demand&quot;

That&#039;s a great point. Sometimes I&#039;ll find myself being nice to others or doing things for other people primarily for the reaction, and then I&#039;ll be disappointed when I don&#039;t get the response I am seeking. When that happens, I have to look at myself and say that I was not being kind, but I was just trying to flatter my ego.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this article - concise yet detailed.  I really resonated with the passage about praise because my father raised me and my siblings in a praise-focused environment.  I was only marginally affected, whereas it has caused major psychological issues in my sister.

For others who are particularly interested in exploring the concept of praise and it&#039;s relationship to unconditional love more closely, I highly recommend this book:

&quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; by Alfie Kohn

After reading it, it radically changed not only the way I planned to parent (my son had not yet been born), but it also changed the way I use and respond to praise.

Even though the book is parenting focused, I think it serves as an excellent read for anybody on a spiritual journey.]]></description>
