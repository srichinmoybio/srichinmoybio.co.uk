		<description><![CDATA[“ To finish the moment, to find the journey’s end in every step of the road, to live the greatest number of good hours, is wisdom.” –Ralph Waldo Emerson 
We once ended a class discussion with a conclusion saying living content is key to happiness. We also know that we can become content with a widening of scope, an embrace to nature, and to live simplified as Thoreau might say. However, if an individual becomes completely immersed in the ego mind and succeeds in the conformity of competition, that single individual is also likely to achieve contentment. Is that ego based individual happy? And is happiness an emotion arises out of comparison, does it come out as an added effect from a situation, or does it require a complete connection of being while maintaining control of the ego mind? Also, we constantly try to analyze life and its meaning, will the enlightenment of truth make us happy, or will it only trigger more questions out of a never-ending loop of logic and reason? Shouldn’t we just enjoy life as it is without trying to understand it or will that be labeled ignorant?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s true. When we seek our own happiness, we do not find it. The feeling of unhappiness we experience is the deep knowledge of our own failiure to live up to the best within us. And so naturally a prideful attitude, seeking one own happiness, only creates more unhappiness within us. But this unhappiness is a gift that shows us the error of our ways, we can never escape it and this is a good thing. Perhaps we cannot all be saints, but I find a very practical way of creating peace within myself is to pray or chant while focusing on the happiness of anybody I may have harmed, and also to against those who have harmed me. Love your enemies, send them as much happiness as you can and then the debt is paid. Never let pride have any power over you if you can help it.]]></description>
