			<h1>Sri Chinmoy Lifts Baby Elephant </h1>
			<p>Sri Chinmoy often finds dramatic and imaginative ways of expressing his  love for Mother Earth and his support for environmental projects. Here  in Thailand, he has taken to lifting baby elephants! On February 18th,  2007, he and a small team of assistants drove south of Chiang Mai into  the heart of the jungle. At the Mae Wong National Park, a herd of  elephants under the supervision of German trainer Bodo Forster were  reported to have a clutch of nursing calves. Sri Chinmoy was  particularly interested in lifting a seven month-old male calf weighing  701 pounds. He even wrote a song celebrating the occasion: </p>
			<div class="poem">
			  <p><br />
			    &quot;Baby elephant, baby elephant, I love you! <br />
			    You are Mother Earth's achievement new. <br />
			    Your father, your mother - strong, stronger, strongest; <br />
			    You are, indeed, cute, cuter, cutest! <br />
			    I love, I love, your sweet family; <br />
		      You give my eyes and my heart purest glee.&quot; </p>
		    </div>
			<p><br />
            After arriving at the elephant camp,<a href="http://del.icio.us/srichinmoy"> Sri Chinmoy's</a> assistants  erected the wood and steel apparatus with its unique overhead lifting  platform on a level area of ground and then waited for the right  moment. But, alas, elephants are not as passive as metal weights! Came  midday, the infant decided to follow his mother down to the pond for a  muddy splash. Refreshed by this exercise, he then emerged from the  water and lay down on the bank for a one hour siesta. Still Sri Chinmoy  waited patiently, in a meditative mood, not wanting to compel the  little pachyderm to do anything that might alarm him. </p>
			<p>			  Finally, the calf awoke and, lured by some sugar cane, stepped  onto the lifting platform. The total weight of the calf and the  moveable platform came to 785 pounds. <a href="http://www.biographyonline.net/spiritual/srichinmoy.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> quickly moved into  position underneath the apparatus. Even though this lift is technically  a standing calf raise, his shoulders would be taking the brunt of the  weight. Another important factor in this lift would be Sri Chinmoy's  age. Despite 22 years of lifting heavy weights, it cannot be gainsayed  that he is now 75 years old and such a crushing load would surely take  its toll. </p>
			<p><img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/weightlifting/images/sri_chinmoy_baby_elephant_lifts.jpg" alt="lifting" width="497" height="365" /> </p>
			<p>Sri Chinmoy placed the balls of his feet on the narrow calf raise  ledge and bent forwards so that the shoulder pads were resting firmly  on his shoulders. He then inhaled deeply and straightened his spine. As  he did so, the platform bearing the baby elephant rose several inches.  Sri Chinmoy held the lift for a few seconds and then allowed the  platform to drop down into its original position. The baby elephant  trundled off and rejoined its mother. In video records of the lift, her  trunk can be seen throughout the lift waving protectively around the  rotund form of her little son. </p>
			<p>			  Mr. Forster was thrilled that Sri Chinmoy had been able to  accomplish his dream. &quot;<em>This has been a great experience for both the  elephant and for me! I am astonished at what Sri Chinmoy has done with  the power of his mind and I am grateful for his encouragement</em>,&quot; Mr.  Forster said. </p>
			<p>			  Some years ago, when Sri Chinmoy lifted a fully grown elephant  weighing 3,600 pounds (using a ground platform attached to the same  standing calf raise machine), he was asked how it is possible for  remarkable feats such as this to further the cause of world peace,  which is so elusive. Sri Chinmoy responded, </p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&quot;In terms of strength, a human being is no match for an  elephant. Just because the elephant knew we could do nothing to it, it  behaved well. So he who is really strong will not fight. For a human  being, the only way to become really strong is to pray and meditate.  When we pray and meditate, we develop inner strength, and this inner  strength is nothing other than peace. The reason I have entered into  bodybuilding and weightlifting is to inspire everybody to pray and  meditate so they can bring to the fore their own inner strength. If  everybody brings to the fore his own inner strength, the world will  eventually be inundated with peace.&quot; </p>

			<p>			  And, in the meantime, Sri Chinmoy plans to go on lifting the baby  elephants of Thailand and to express his tangible support for the  elephants' continued survival. </p>
