			<h1>Sri Chinmoy Weightlifting 2 </h1>
			<p>Sri Chinmoy began <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/weightlifting/index.html">weightlifting</a> on June 26 1985 with a clean  and press 40 lb lift. By November of 1985 he had succeed in lifting his own  body weight of 155lbs. His progress was rapid breaking all usual conventions  about slow and steady progress. On 30th Jan 1987 <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/index.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> succeeded in lifting with one arm (right) an unprecedented 7,063lbs. Bill Pearl  described this as a &ldquo;20th Century Miracle&rdquo; On 04 August 1988 Sri Chinmoy lifted 7040lb with the other hand (left). These lifts were from a platform, specially constructed for the lift. After this lift there followed a break in serious weightlifting, but in the late 1990s Sri Chinmoy renewed his weightlifting career, completing on 09 May 2000 a 1,300-lb standing overhead Double Dumbell Lift. </p>

			<p> Sri Chinmoy states that he does not lift in order to compete  with others, he is not interested in breaking world records. For Sri Chinmoy  weightlifting is something that enables him to compete with himself, to enable  self transcendence. Self Transcendence or the breaking of self imposed limits  is a feature of many aspects in his life. Many lifts of Sri Chinmoy take place  early in the morning as part of his spiritual disciplines. Between the years of  1998 and 2001 he offered 1,300 <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sri-chinmoy-soul-body-prayers/part1/toc.html">weightlifting prayers</a> before each morning  lift.&nbsp; These prayers can be viewed at  Sri Chinmoy Library giving the date, time and type of lift.</p>
			<p>Although many lifts are in his private home in Queens  Sri Chinmoy also uses his unique weightlifting as a way to inspire others. His  lifting has appeared many times on TV throughout America and Europe, they are  often included at the end of a news program as a positive news item.  Approaching 75 years of age Sri Chinmoy is particularly keen to inspire others  not to give up. In this video of <a href="http://www.srichinmoy.tv/tv/7/">740lb double dumbbell lift</a> Sri Chinmoy  dedicates his lift to those of his own generation. Through lifting Sri Chinmoy  wishes to show that old age is only in the mind and not the heart.</p>
