			<h2>A NEW ERA OF STRENGTH FEATS<strong> </strong></h2>
			<p><br />
		    Part 6 </p>
			<p>On  September 16th, Sri Chinmoy lifted his first car. One of his  students had duplicated the essential design of a calf raise machine and  attached to it a metal frame with tracks that a car could back onto. This meant  that the front wheels of the car remained on the ground while the back wheels  rested on the tracks. This was a totally different kind of car lift from those in which a device is hooked underneath the  back fender. Sri Chinmoy's lift displaced the centre of gravity with the  result that a much greater proportion of the true weight of the car was  actually lifted.
			  The car used in this  first lift was a small Datsun.&nbsp; The 
			  machine was erected just outside the tennis court so that  Sri 
			  Chinmoy could prepare himself for  the lift by warming up on
			  his standard calf raise machine. Cars have been lifted in  the
			  past by some of history's legendary strongmen, but none  had
			  used this particular form of lift, where most of the  weight was
			  borne by the calf muscles. Somehow, it made Sri Chinmoy's
			  leg strength appear even more tangible to see the  traditional
			  weight stack translated into terms of equivalent objects  from
			  everyday life. Sri Chinmoy lifted the car twice, holding  the
		    second lift at full extension for seven seconds.</p>
			<p>			  The era of explosive  lifting had arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 19th, Sri Chinmoy advanced to a Maverick model  car. By this time, Sri Chinmoy's students had located the nearest weigh  bridge for trucks and so they were able to obtain an accurate weight for the  car. Sri Chinmoy takes up the story from here: &quot;Our philosophy is  self-transcendence.&nbsp; Two days ago,&nbsp;&nbsp; I lifted a car with my calves. At that  time, no human beings were sitting in the car. Today, again, I wanted to lift a  car. This time it happened to be my car. The weight of the car is 2,960 pounds  and the apparatus for lifting is 82 pounds. So, altogether 3,042 pounds were  loaded onto the machine.<br />
&quot;I lifted the car twice. Then, on the third lift, three persons were inside the car. The weight on the calf  machine was 3,521 &frac14; pounds. On the fourth lift, five persons were inside.  The car and the weight came to 3,811 &frac34; pounds. On the fifth lift, seven persons  and the car totalled &bull;1.107 pounds.</p>
			<p>&quot;On  the sixth lift &mdash; this one really killed me &mdash; four persons were in the front  seat, four were in the back seat and three were on top of the car. There were  eleven people altogether. The weight came to 4,515 &frac12;&nbsp; pounds. I have no idea scientifically how  much I actually lifted. Our great mathematicians and physicists are working it out. I lifted the 4,515 &frac12;&nbsp; pounds twice  and held it for around seven seconds. Luckily, I am still alive. Now I shall take rest from the car  lift for a long time, because I really  suffered a lot.&quot;</p>
			<p>			  In spite of  Sri Chinmoy's immediate reaction, however, scarcely  two days had elapsed before a third car  found its way onto his calf raise machine. This time it was a  1980 Buick Sedan, by far the heaviest  car to date with a weight of 3,487 pounds.<br />
		    Sri Chinmoy lifted the car twice, the first time alone and the second time with the addition of five  passengers. The final weight of this last lift was 4,422 pounds. It was  especially noticeable that Sri  Chinmoy seemed to attack the lift suddenly, carefully concentrating and controlling  his energy and then allowing  it to explode through his calves. Later that day  Sri Chinmoy offered an interesting insight into his lifting technique:</p>
			<p>&quot;Today,  the first time I lifted the car, I got such a severe  cramp in my left side. This cramp was  not like a running cramp. A running  cramp is a sharp pain, but it does not cover  the whole area. This cramp that I got  while I was lifting covered the whole muscle.</p>
			<p>&quot;Although, in terms  of weight, this lift was supposed to be 60 pounds less than when I lifted the last car, this time it seemed heavier.  When I succeed in lifting, it has to be at the very firsti push. If the weight does not go up when I first  push, &nbsp;then it will never go up. There is no hope. It will  only sink. This applies to both the calf  lifts and my one-arm lifts.&quot;</p>
			<p>			  One observation  regarding the distribution of weight in this lift is that,  of the five passengers involved
  two men, both men were seated in the  back seat, the section of the car closest to Sri Chinmoy. At 246 pounds and  219&frac14;&nbsp; pounds, this tended to concentrate  the weight towards the rear.</p>
			<p>			  When  asked about their experience afterwards, one of the men remarked:  &quot;It was an amazing feeling being lifted up. Probably the only  comparable experience would be during an earthquake &mdash;it  was the magnitude of an earthquake.&quot; The second one added:  &quot;It felt like a ride in the elevator &mdash;it just went up and there was no  hesitation. It was like a short ride in a very powerful freight  elevator.&quot;</p>
			<p>			  Sri  Chinmoy capped off his morning of calf raises by lifting six men who were standing on  a platform on top of his standard calf raise machine. The combined weight of  this lift was 1384 pounds.</p>
			<p>			  Sri Chinmoy's imagination  had opened up a whole new world of lifting. It was to become a noisy and  colourful parade of life, a circus, a zoo, a caravan of passing images. The  succession of human beings, animals, machinery and other animate and inanimate  objects that crowded onto his machine over the next few weeks had an  astonishing effect. In essence <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/weightlifting/lifting2004.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> was bringing weightlifting out of  the gym and making it a part and parcel of everyday life. But, most importantly  of all, he was infusing it with joy.</p>
