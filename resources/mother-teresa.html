			  <h4 >Short Biography Mother Teresa </h4>
			  <p >Mother  Teresa was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Skopje, Macedonia, on August  27, 1910. Her family was of Albanian descent. At the age of twelve, she  felt strongly the call of God and wished to become a missionary of  Christ, helping to spread the love of Christ. At the age of eighteen  she left her parental home in Skopje and joined the Sisters of Loreto,  an Irish community of nuns with missions in India. After a few months'  training in Dublin she was sent to India, where on May 24, 1931, she  took her initial vows as a nun. From 1931 to 1948 Mother Teresa taught  at a high school in Calcutta. The poverty of India&rsquo;s poor left a  profound impression on her and she felt inspired to leave the convent  and devote her life to the service and care for the poor.</p>
			  <p >By  1950 she had been joined by others who were willing to help. She also  received permission from the Vatican to start her own order &ldquo;The  missionaries of Charity&rdquo; This became an official international  religious family in 1965.</p>
			  <p >The activities  of the missionaries of charity has now spread all over the world,  helping to provide assistance for the most disadvantaged of society.  This has included work in the West dealing with victims of AIDS and  drug abuse. For her tireless work to serve the poor Mother Teresa has  received many awards and notable recognition. Most prominently she was  awarded the Nobel Prize in 1979.She did not attend the usual banquet  but asked that the money to be given to charity.</p>
			  <p >Mother Teresa died on 5 September 1997 aged 87. The Vatican have started the process towards beatification.<br />

			  <div class="poem">
			    <p >&ldquo;If any dying sufferer on earth<br />
			      Needs someone to cry for him,<br />
			      With him and in him,<br />
			      Then he can unmistakably see<br />
			      Mother Teresa's all-embracing arms<br />
			      Faster than the fastest<br />
			      Approaching him.&rdquo; </p>

			  <div class="poem">
			    <p >&ldquo;Mother Teresa does many, many things<br />
			      For the betterment of the world,<br />
			      But when she washes away<br />
			      The untold sufferings<br />
			      Of the unloved ones<br />
			      With her heart's streaming tears-<br />
			      That is by far the best.&rdquo;</p>

			  <p >&nbsp;</p>
			  <p >Mother Teresa also offered her kind encouragement and gratitude to Sri Chinmoy </p>
			  <div class="poem">
			    <p >&quot;  Thank you for all you are to God, for the beautiful work you have done  for the glory of God and the good of souls. I keep you in my prayer and  I count on your continual support through your prayers and sacrifices  that we may do God's work with great love for His greater glory.&quot;</p>
