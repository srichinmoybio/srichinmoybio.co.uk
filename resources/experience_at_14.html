			<h2>An Experience of the Author Aged 14 </h2>
			<p>By: Sri Chinmoy</p>
			<p>&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Whenever I had the opportunity. I flew to the edge of the  ever-blue sea and took my seat there in solitude. My bird of consciousness,  dancing slowly, rose to the sky and lost itself up there.</p>
			<p>On that occasion &ndash; it was a full-moon night &ndash; as I gazed and  gazed upon the blue-white horizon, I found only light, a sea of sweet and  serene light. All was engulfed as it were, in an ocean of light which played  lovingly on the sweet ripples.</p>
			<p>My finite consciousness was in quest of the Infinite and  Immortal. I drank deeply of Ambrosia and was floating on an illumined ocean. It  seemed that I no longer existed on this earth.</p>
			<p>All of a sudden &ndash; I do not know why or how &ndash; something put  an end to my sweet dream. No longer did the air emit its honey &ndash; like immortal  Bliss, for my own depressed thoughts had come to the fore: &ldquo;Useless, everything  is useless. There is no hope of creating a divine world here on earth. It is  only a childish dream.&rdquo; I felt, too, that I could not go on even with my own  life. This seemed to be nothing but a thorny desert strewn with endless difficulties.<br />
  &ldquo;Why should I suffer these unbearable pains and sorrows  here? I am the son of the Infinite. I must have freedom. I must have the  ecstasy of Paradise. This ecstasy resides ever within me. Why then should I not  leave this mortal world for my Eternal Abode in Heaven?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>A sudden flash of lightning appeared over my head. Looking  up with awe and bewilderment, I found above me my Beloved, the King of the  Universe, looking at me. His radiant Face was overcast with sorrow.<br />
  &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; I asked, approaching Him, &ldquo;what makes Thy Face so  sad?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;How can I be happy, My son, if you do not wish to be My  companion and help Me in My Mission? I have, concealed in the world, millions  of sweet plans, which I shall unravel. If my children do not help Me in My  play, how can I have My divine manifestation here on earth?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Profoundly moved, I bowed and promised: &ldquo;Father. I will be  Thy faithful companion, loving and sincere, throughout Eternity. Shape me and  make me worthy of my part in Thy Cosmic Play and Thy divine Mission.&rdquo;</p>
