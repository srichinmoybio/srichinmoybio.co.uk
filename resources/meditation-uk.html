			<h1>Learn to  Meditate in UK.</h1>
			<p align="center"><img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/images/flowers/pink_lotus.jpg" width="295" height="241" alt="meditation" /></p>
			<p>The UK  Sri Chinmoy Centres have been offering <a href="http://www.srichinmoycentre.org/uk/meditation">free meditation classes</a> in the UK for  over 25 years.</p>
			<p>The  meditation classes are based on the teachings of meditation teacher Sri  Chinmoy. </p>
			<p class="quote">&ldquo;We meditate for various  reasons. Peace of mind we all badly need. Therefore, when we meditate, either  consciously or unconsciously we aim at peace of mind. Meditation gives us peace  of mind without a tranquilliser. And unlike a tranquilliser, the peace of mind  that we get from meditation does not fade away. It lasts for good in some  corner of the inmost recesses of our aspiring heart.&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="number">- Sri Chinmoy (1) </p>
			<p>The  meditation techniques offered share many similarities with other types of  meditation; however one feature of this form of meditation is the emphasis  placed on meditating on the heart. The benefit of meditating on the spiritual  heart is that the heart embodies the qualities of expansion, love, peace and  oneness; it is these qualities that we seek to bring to the fore whilst  meditating.</p>
			<p>The  introductory meditation classes focus on some of the basics of meditation.  These include:</p>
			<h3>Relaxation techniques. </h3>
			<p>Relaxation  techniques teach us how to switch off the mind and body from the day's  activities, this is essential as a precursor to meditation.</p>
			<h3>  Concentration techniques. </h3>
			<p>Concentration  means the ability to focus on one thing at a time; concentration involves a one  pointed focus. Whatever our object of concentration, we become absorbed in this  and nothing else. Concentration exercises may involve focusing on a candle or  flower flame. Through the practice of concentration we generate the ability to  achieve a concentration of thought and energy, essential to meditation.</p>
			<h3>  Meditation with a silent Mind. </h3>
			<p>Real  meditation involves stopping our thoughts completely. In order to meditate well  we need to have a silent mind and be able to control our thoughts. Many  meditation exercises are designed to help us attain this.</p>
			<h3>  Meditation and Music.</h3>
			<p>Spiritual  music can be of great aid to meditation. Meditative music inspires us to dive  deep within, beyond the domain of the mind. Sri Chinmoy has composed a wide  range of spiritual music, which is ideal for use during meditation. For example  the CD &quot;Flute Music for Meditation&quot; is often used during meditation  classes. Flute music for meditation is popular for use in meditation because  the music embodies a calming, ethereal quality. During meditation classes music  groups often perform spiritual music composed by Sri Chinmoy. For many  participants this is often the highlight of the course.</p>
			<h3>Further Reading</h3>
			<p>For  those interested in learning to meditate courses usually make use of 2 books by  Sri Chinmoy. </p>
			<ul>
			  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wings-Joy-Inspirational-Meditations-Anecdotes/dp/0684822423">The  Wings of Joy</a> is an introduction to meditation. It is also has practical  suggestions for bringing more inner peace and happiness into daily life.</li>
			  <li><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/resources/meditation_book.html">Meditation  by Sri Chinmoy</a> is a more detailed guide to meditation. The book covers various  topics on meditation and several suggested exercises for concentration and  meditation. There are also question and answer sections with common questions  about meditation.</li>
		    </ul>
			<h3>  Feedback</h3>
			<p>Students  of Sri Chinmoy, who have been meditating for several years, offer the  meditation courses. During the course there will be the opportunity to ask  questions about meditation and the philosophy of Sri Chinmoy.</p>
			<h3> Free  of Charge.</h3>
			<p>At Sri  Chinmoy's request all meditation classes are offered free of charge. This is in  keeping with the Indian tradition that spiritual teachings cannot be bought and  sold, and should be available to all. </p>
			<h3>  Community Service.</h3>
			<p>During  the past 30 years, meditation classes by the Sri Chinmoy Centres have been  offered in over 60 different countries around the world. At a conservative  estimate over 1 million people have benefited from the opportunity to learn  about meditation. No commitment or fee is required to participate in the  meditation classes.</p>
			<h3>Sri  Chinmoy.</h3>
