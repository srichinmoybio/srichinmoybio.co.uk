			<h1>Meditation by Sri Chinmoy</h1>
			<h4>Meditation: Man-Perfection in God-Satisfaction (1989) </h4>
			<p>Meditation by Sri Chinmoy is a short guide to the  fundamentals of learning to meditate. Split into different chapters, Meditation  deals with both the basics and advanced issues of meditation. For example Sri  Chinmoy explains how breathing and concentration exercises can be used to calm  the mind. There are also sections on Samadhi and the highest experiences of  meditation.</p>
			<p>Throughout the book there are question and answer sections.  These include questions, common to all beginners of meditation. For example, a  very common problem that people experience when learning to meditate is; &ldquo;how  to silence the mind?&rdquo; Sri Chinmoy advises that the best place to meditate is in  the spiritual heart. It is in the heart that a seeker is able to distance  himself from the critical thinking mind. If one can enter into the heart it is  possible to experience the silence and expanse of real meditation.</p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&ldquo;If you meditate in the heart, you are meditating where the  soul is&hellip; If you want illumination, you have to get it from the soul, which is  inside the heart.&rdquo;</p>
		    </div>
			<p>Meditation is invaluable reference book; it is not necessary  to read it from beginning to end and try to absorb all the information at once.  It is a book, which can be dipped into from time to time. Also to get the most  from the book meditation, it is also essential to try and practise the various  exercises offered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Meditation&rsquo; is not  so much concerned with the theory of meditation but how it can be of practical  use in helping a seeker in their own meditation.</p>
			<p>As well as offering clear advice about the basics of  meditation, reading this book &ldquo;Meditation&rdquo; will offer encouragement and  inspiration to begin and continue meditating. One short chapter is titled &ldquo;Do  not Give Up&rdquo; Sri Chinmoy encourages the reader to persevere with meditation  even as difficulties arise. </p>
			<p>There are also numerous aphorisms offering a poetic  inspiration for meditation. For example one aphorism of Sri Chinmoy says:</p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&ldquo;Do you need happiness? Then do just three things: Meditate  regularly. Smile soulfully, Love untiringly.&rdquo;</p>
		    </div>
			<p>These short aphorisms make a useful complement to the text  and guidelines on meditation.</p>
			<p>Sri Chinmoy writes with a clarity that stems from his own  inner experiences of meditation. &lsquo;Meditation&rsquo; helps to clear the obstacles a  newcomer may experience. It offers a simple and practical approach to improve  your meditation. It is invaluable for beginners but also serves as a reference  even for those who have been meditating for along time. Meditation by Sri  Chinmoy is an important reminder of the fundamentals of meditation and its  inherent simplicity.</p>
