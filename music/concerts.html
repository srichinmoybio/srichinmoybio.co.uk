			<h1>Concerts of Sri Chinmoy </h1>
			
			<p>During the  past 20 years <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/index.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> has offered over 500 concerts of prayerful music  around the world. Typically these have been held in large auditoriums capable  of holding several 1000 people.Venues of Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s concerts have included  the Royal Albert Hall, London; Borobudur, Indonesia; Kamakura, Japan; and  Sydney Opera House.</p>
			<p>During  these concerts  Sri Chinmoy will play on a variety of instruments. These include  meditative instruments like the Esraj and Flutes. Maestro Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s  repertoire also includes instruments which express great dynamism and power.  Often the conclusion to a concert will be a rousing finale on a piano,  synthesizer or organ. These extemporaneous performances offer a unique and  powerful musical effect but Sri Chinmoy says dynamism and energy are still  complementary to inner peace. Inner peace is not just about silence and  calmness. Peace can embody dynamism and energy.</p>
			<p> Many commentators have observed how Sri  Chinmoy&rsquo;s music touches their heart and uplifts their inspiration beyond the  mind. It is for this reason that Sri Chinmoy prefers to offer concerts of  prayerful music rather than giving lectures like he did in the 1970s. When  giving lectures Sri Chinmoy feels it is difficult to offer spiritual  inspiration. A talk only deals with the intellectual mind, there is also a  sense of separation between the speaker and the audience. With music Sri  Chinmoy says he is able to identify with the audience and they can identify  with the music. &ldquo;Music is the universal language of god&rdquo; music spreads oneness,  through music Sri Chinmoy feels he is able to touch the aspiring hearts of seekers</p>
			<p>Sri Chinmoy  has also composed songs about individuals. This is a unique way of offering  gratitude and honouring the achievements of a diverse range of individuals.  People honoured in such a way include prominent world leaders such as Mikhail  Gorbachev, Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela. This is one such song composed in  honour of Mother Teresa:</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<div class="poem">
			  <p>&ldquo;Affection-Sister, Compassion-Mother Teresa Divine<br />
		      Every day God's Smile, Joy and Pride<br />
		      with your soul dine.<br />
		      Mother, your Calcutta's streaming tears <br />
		      and bleeding heart you are.<br />
		      To you the whole world bows and bows <br />
		      from near and far.<br />
		      Your life is the fragrance of <br />
		      the world-peace-dream-flower.<br />
		      Yours is the breath that builds God's<br />
		      Satisfaction-Tower.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>In addition to composing songs in honour of individuals Sri Chinmoy has also set others inspiring words to music. When meeting people Sri Chinmoy seeks to highlight the best in others by focusing on their good qualities and appreciating their noblest sentiments. </p>
			Sri Chinmoy has also composed many songs in honour of  great spiritual Masters from Sri Ramachandra to Sri Aurobindo. Through  composing songs in honour of the great Masters and founders of world religions  Sri Chinmoy has sought to highlight the underlying unity of world religions. In  particular he has composed many songs about Sri Krishna, The Buddha, Jesus  Christ and Sri Aurobindo.&nbsp;
