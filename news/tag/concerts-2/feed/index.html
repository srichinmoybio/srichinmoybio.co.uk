				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently &#8211; Oneness-Dream,  a group of male singers from the Sri Chinmoy Centre visited Scotland to perform the songs of Sri Chinmoy at a variety of churches, monasteries and temples.</p>

<p>The group performed a total of 15 performances in different locations ranging from short, spontaneous performances to full concerts of about 1 hour.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2433" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-10-08-at-14.05.03.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-08 at 14.05.03" width="378" height="254" /></p>
<p>Highlights of the tour included performing at Iona, Findhorn and the Hindu Temple in Glasgow during the Glasgow Mandir. The tour was often described by participants as a pilgrimage &#8211; the singers visited many of the famous holy sites of Scoltand &#8211; including ancient spiritual centres such as Whithorn, Kilmartin and Iona and more modern centres, such as  Findhorn and Gorbals Parish.</p>

<div data-canvas-width="180.581776" data-angle="0" data-font-name="Georgia">In Whithorn the group sang at the Abbey ruins and also at the site of &#8211; perhaps &#8211; the first Christian settlement in Scotland. It was by the sea and the weather was unusually very still and calm.</div>
