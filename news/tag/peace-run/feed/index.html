<blockquote><p>Right now fear, doubt, anxiety, tension and disharmony are reigning supreme. But there shall come a time when this world of ours will be flooded with peace. Who is going to bring about that radical change? It will be you: you and your sisters and brothers, who are an extension of your reality-existence. It will be you and your oneness-heart, which is spread throughout the length and breadth of the world. Peace is unity. Peace is oneness, within and without.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday 17th May, the city of Leeds was re-dedicated as a Sri Chinmoy Peace-Blossom, during a ceremony attended by the Mayor of Leeds and members of the Peace Run who are travelling through England.</p>
<p>Leeds was initially dedicated as a Peace City in 1995 on United Nations day, 24th October 1995. This May, the Sri Chinmoy Peace Run is travelling through England and up to Scotland as part of the European Peace Run. With the run passing through Leeds, the city of Leeds kindly agreed to make a new plaque and honour the Peace Run.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2380" alt="peace-run-team-backdrop-leeds" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/peace-run-team-backdrop-leeds-500x375.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>The Lord Mayor of Leeds Councillor Tom Murray unveiled the plaque and spoke welcoming the runners and affirming the city of Leeds&#8217; commitment to diversity, tolerance and the promotion of peace. <span id="more-2378"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2381" alt="mayor-torch" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/mayor-torch.jpg" width="450" height="315" /></p>
<p>The Lord Mayor of Leeds and his wife Edna.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2379" alt="plaque" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/plaque1-500x375.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>The plaque reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A world of peace and harmony has been humanity&#8217;s dream since time immemorial. Today Leeds joins hundreds of communities throughout the world dedicated to the cause of peace and international friendship. Other such Peace Blossoms include the cities of Ottawa, Canberra, Auckland, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Reykavik and natural wonders such as the Niagara Falls and the Matterhorn.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A Sri Chinmoy Peace Blossom is a beacon of inspiration, to promote a strong sense of world family among people. It takes its name from Sri Chinmoy, an ambassador for peace who committed his life to the pursuit of world harmony. Leeds has long been home to people of many different cultures and believes. Through its status as a Nuclear Free Local Authority, it has worked to free the world of the the of nuclear annihilation. The peace loving people of Leeds are proud to honour our city&#8217;s historic commitment to peace and join our vibrant and graceful city with the global family of Sri Chinmoy Peace Blossoms.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In dedicating Leeds as a Peace City on the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we register our hopes for the day when nations may work together in peace and people may live together in harmony.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Leeds City Council, United Nations Day, 24th October 1995.</p>
<p>&#8220;O dreamers of peace, come. Let us walk together. O lovers of peace, come. Let us run together. O servers of peace, come. Let us grow together.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is steadily making its progress across the European continent, offering a message of peace and goodwill. The Peace Run began it&#8217;s momentous journey in Belgium this February, before travelling through Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and now through the Balkan countries. It will continue to travel through many European countries before finishing in Belgrade this autumn.</p>

<p>President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy lit the Peace Torch in Brussels to mark the beginning of the 2014 run <a href="http://www.peacerun.org/be/news/2014/0211/">(Link)</a></p>
<p>Mr. Van Rompuy said on the opening day “<em>Establishing, maintaining and developing peace is an ongoing run, an ongoing battle. (…) So thank you for everything you are doing to bring people closer together. You are proving to us that taking part in this Run is not just exercise or sport. It is, I insist on it, a way of life.”</em></p>

<p>The Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run was founded in 1987 by peace visionary, Sri Chinmoy. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s time in the West, and remains a powerful vehicle for spreading peace throughout thousands of individuals around the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is no human being on earth<br />
Who does not have the capacity<br />
To offer the message of peace<br />
To the world at large.<br />
But what is needed now<br />
Is the soulful willingness. <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/ap-18991">1</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 15th August, the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run completed its epic, 3 month, 15,872 km journey around the continent of Australia.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2242" alt="aus-2013-final-group-sea2" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/aus-2013-final-group-sea2.jpg" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p>The Peace Run began in April in Canberra, and over the past 3 months, a team of international runners have run clockwise around Australia visiting all the major cities, such as Perth, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, and Sydney . Along the way they have met many people who have participated in this endeavour to promote peace and goodwill.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Peace, universal peace,<br />
Is definitely within the reach<br />
Of all.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy[1]</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2243" alt="aus-2013-closing" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/aus-2013-closing.jpg" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p>At the closing ceremony in Canberra, Prachar Stegemann offered these words on the meaning of the run.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Sri Chinmoy founded the Peace Run in 1987, as a dynamic expression of our eternal journey towards a better world.<span id="more-2241"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Here we are talking about peace, yet through talking we do not achieve peace. Let us rather enjoy a minute&#8217;s pure silence to embrace peace, to imagine inside our hearts that perfect world where love, joy and oneness reign supreme&#8230; [one minute of silent meditation followed]</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Everything valuable starts in our hearts and in imagination – world peace is no different. If we can imagine a perfect world, then rest assured, that perfect world is just around the corner.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Sri Chinmoy used to say that if we look at the moon we can either appreciate, love and claim its beauty, or we can analyse and deplore its spots and imperfections.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;In the world around us, we can find many weaknesses and faults if we look for them. Yet carrying this Torch of hope all the way around this vast continent, we have encountered a world of astonishing beauty, blossoming joy, beaming smiles and wide open hearts. (more on <a href="http://www.peacerun.org/au/news/2013/0815/w8YVoV7H/">Peace Run closing ceremony</a>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p>During the journey around Australia, the Peace Run team visited many schools to give schoolchildren the opportunity to participate in the Peace Run.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently a statue of Sri Chinmoy holding a Peace Torch was dedicated at Chantery Park, Ipswich; the statue was a gift from the Oneness-Home Peace Run, and marked the culmination of a week long Peace Run from Cardiff to Ipswich.</p>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="ipwsich-statue" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/ipwsich-statue-500x391.jpg" width="500" height="391" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Statue with Mayor of Ipswich and sculptor Kaivalya Torpy</p></div>
<p>Sri Chinmoy visited Ipswich on two occasions, in the the 1980s and 1990s, and the city is a member of the Sri Chinmoy Peace Blossoms programme. Several athletic events have also been offered by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team in Ipswich over the years.</p>
<p>The organiser of the event, Martin Spettigue commented that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“We want to offer something that will inspire people to think more and more about peace and to understand how important peace is to an individual.”</p>
<p>The Mayor of Ipswich offered his gratitude to the Peace Run team for kindly offering this symbol of peace and said it would be a great asset to Chantery Park.</p>
<p><span id="more-2223"></span></p>
<p>During the ceremony, the Peace Run offered a &#8216;Harmony Torch Bearer Award&#8217;  to the Reverend Clifford Reed (a poet, artist, and Unitarian Minister for 36 years.) The &#8216;Harmony Torch Bearer Award&#8217; is a recognition for individuals who have selfless offered a positive contribution to their local communities . The Reverend Clifford Reed was honoured, amongst other achievements, for his sterling work in bringing different religions together. He was a founder member and chairman of the Ipswich interfaith movement.  He is also a leading poet, and writer.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.peacerun.org/">Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run</a> is an international event which seeks to promote peace and harmony across the world. Since its inception in 1987, it has travelled through many countries and given thousands of people the opportunity to participate in offering a wish for world peace.</p>
<p>This year, the British Peace Run, began in Cardiff and travelled across the country through Bristol, Oxford and Cambridge before arriving in Ipswich. The Peace Run started with the Mayor of Cardiff offering a message of goodwill to the other mayors along the way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Australia, the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home peace run recently began its epic 112 day circumnavigation around the continent of Australia.</p>
<p>The Peace Run was founded by Sri Chinmoy in 1987, with the aim of providing a dynamic way to spread the ideals of peace, harmony and goodwill around the world. In recent years, it has been called the World Harmony Run, but in 2013, the Australian Peace Run returns to its original name.</p>

<p>The members of the peace run team included volunteers from around the world. During the day, the team members take turns to run with the torch. The runners also take the opportunity to meet with local dignitaries, local schools and local members of the community.</p>
