				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently a statue of Sri Chinmoy holding a Peace Torch was dedicated at Chantery Park, Ipswich; the statue was a gift from the Oneness-Home Peace Run, and marked the culmination of a week long Peace Run from Cardiff to Ipswich.</p>

<p>Sri Chinmoy visited Ipswich on two occasions, in the the 1980s and 1990s, and the city is a member of the Sri Chinmoy Peace Blossoms programme. Several athletic events have also been offered by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team in Ipswich over the years.</p>
<p>The organiser of the event, Martin Spettigue commented that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“We want to offer something that will inspire people to think more and more about peace and to understand how important peace is to an individual.”</p>
<p>The Mayor of Ipswich offered his gratitude to the Peace Run team for kindly offering this symbol of peace and said it would be a great asset to Chantery Park.</p>
<p><span id="more-2223"></span></p>
<p>During the ceremony, the Peace Run offered a &#8216;Harmony Torch Bearer Award&#8217;  to the Reverend Clifford Reed (a poet, artist, and Unitarian Minister for 36 years.) The &#8216;Harmony Torch Bearer Award&#8217; is a recognition for individuals who have selfless offered a positive contribution to their local communities . The Reverend Clifford Reed was honoured, amongst other achievements, for his sterling work in bringing different religions together. He was a founder member and chairman of the Ipswich interfaith movement.  He is also a leading poet, and writer.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.peacerun.org/">Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run</a> is an international event which seeks to promote peace and harmony across the world. Since its inception in 1987, it has travelled through many countries and given thousands of people the opportunity to participate in offering a wish for world peace.</p>
<p>This year, the British Peace Run, began in Cardiff and travelled across the country through Bristol, Oxford and Cambridge before arriving in Ipswich. The Peace Run started with the Mayor of Cardiff offering a message of goodwill to the other mayors along the way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This statue of Sri Chinmoy is located on the banks of the river Vltava in Prague; in recent days, it has featured in many newspapers as images show the devastating flood waters, rising to partially submerge the statue.</p>
<div id="attachment_2138" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-2138" alt="Statue-of-Sri-Chinmoy-flooded-in-Prague-2-Apaguha-Vesely" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Statue-of-Sri-Chinmoy-flooded-in-Prague-2-Apaguha-Vesely.jpg" width="500" height="349" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Apaguha Vesely</p></div>
<p>Sri Chinmoy (1931-2007) dedicated his life to the promotion of peace. He founded the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run and offered over 700 Peace Concerts around the world.</p>
<p>The beautiful statue was created by British sculptor, Kaivalya Torpy and was dedicated in a ceremony during October 2009. At the opening ceremony, Kaivalya Torpy  said he hoped that the statue of Sri Chinmoy would stand as a symbol of peace and hope, and inspire the next generation of peace lovers.</p>

<p>Sri Chinmoy wrote many short poems on the theme of peace and hope.</p>
<blockquote><p>World-peace<br />
Can be achieved<br />
When the power of love<br />
Replaces<br />
The love of power.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<blockquote><p>No matter what happens,<br />
Do not lose hope,<br />
For once hope is gone,<br />
Everything is gone.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy [2]</p>
