				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Manatita Hutchinson, a student of Sri Chinmoy for over 30 years, has recently written a book about Sri Chinmoy and being on Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s path. <span id="more-2300"></span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-2301 alignleft" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" alt="manatita" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/manatita.jpg" width="200" />The book <em>&#8216;My Guru, Sri Chinmoy: Life and Teachings&#8217; </em>offers Manatita&#8217;s personal perspective on the life and teachings of Sri Chinmoy. It includes some chapters on Manatita&#8217;s first steps into the spiritual life and how he came to adopt the lifestyle of a seeker. He also places into context what he feels are the most important teachings from Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s body of works.</p>
<p>For those wishing to gain an insight into the spiritual philosophy of Sri Chinmoy, this makes an excellent introduction. Pir Zia Inayat Khan, Head, Sufi Order International, writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Sri Chinmoy was a dear friend of my father, Pir Vilayat, and a kind presence in my own life. Manatita Hutchinson&#8217;s lucid account of his life and teachings is a valuable contribution to the Guru&#8217;s legacy, and will be welcomed by all who knew and esteemed him.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Manatita says he was inspired to write the book because he wished to share with sincere seekers how much his own life has been shaped and moulded by his Guru, Sri Chinmoy. Manatita says that he feels he has only been able to give a glimpse into the Master-disciple relationship and what Sri Chinmoy means, but he hopes that it will provide an objective introduction into the philosophy and life of Sri Chinmoy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new compilation of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s stories have been published in the Czech Republic. Entitled &#8216;The Golden Swan&#8217;, it is a collection of stories, beautifully illustrated by Hungarian caricaturist Ludmilla Máthé.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1904" title="cz-stories" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/cz-stories.jpg" alt="cz-stories" width="400" height="342" /></p>
<p>These stories of goodness, love and forgiveness by Sri Chinmoy are written from the heart and for the heart; they will be enjoyed by both children and adults alike. Many of these stories tell about a rich variety of characters who lived in ancient India; stories which have been told and retold from time immemorial. Others are placed in the present time or a timeless world. Whatever the time period, they provide an entertaining and enlightening perspective on life.</p>
