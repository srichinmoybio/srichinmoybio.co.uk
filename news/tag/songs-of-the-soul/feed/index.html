O run and dive and fly-Bliss, Infinity&#8217;s Bliss! The world shall cheer the road with a God-surrender-song. Creator&#8217;s Silence-Hearts, creation&#8217;s sound-lives throng.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy, <em><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/new-millennium/twenty-first-century-the-new-millennium%21">The New Millenium</a></em></p>
