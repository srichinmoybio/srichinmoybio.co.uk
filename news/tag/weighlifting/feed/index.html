				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Bristol, members of the Sri Chinmoy Centre have organised an exhibition of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s weightlifting equipment along with other events, such as free meditation classes.</p>

<p>At the exhibition, there are frequent screenings of the film &#8211; Challenging Impossibility &#8211; a 30 minute film which captures the essence of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s unique weightlifting odyssey. (See: <a href="http://www.challengingimpossibility.com/">Challenging Impossibility.com</a>)</p>
<p>The weightlifting equipment includes standard weightlifting machines, such as calf-raises, wrist curls and bench presses. However, it also includes some of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s innovative and new types of lift. In particular, Sri Chinmoy lifted many people overhead from a seated position, in a specially constructed apparatus. This was part of the &#8216;<em>Lifting up the world with a Oneness-Heart</em>&#8216; programme.</p>

<p>A lift which honoured over 7,000 individuals from all walks of life, including Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa and other dignitaries, sportsmen and musicians. See more at: <a href="http://www.inspiration-lifts.org/lifting-up-the-world/">Lifting up the World at Inspiration Lifts</a>.</p>

<p>During the week long exhibition, there have also been several evening functions, including meditation classes. Sri Chinmoy was a great advocate of meditation and ascribed his unique weightlifting capacities to the inner strength and grace received through prayer and meditation.</p>
