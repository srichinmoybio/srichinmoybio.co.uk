				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Radio Sri Chinmoy, we have recently published a new album of songs about Jesus Christ &#8211; performed by Agnikana&#8217;s group.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2324" style="margin-left: 9px; margin-right: 9px;" alt="christ songs" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-12-21-at-19.53.14.png" width="222" height="203" /></p>
<p>The songs were recorded during a performance of the play ‘The Son’ in Karlínské Spektrum Theatre in Prague during February 2008. The Son, is a play written by Sri Chinmoy about the Saviour Christ. View: <a href="http://www.radiosrichinmoy.org/11940/christ-songs-agnikanas-group/">Christ Songs by Agnikana&#8217;s group</a></p>
<p>In the forward to the play, Sri Chinmoy writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Jesus son of God, avatar of the Western consciousness. Jesus accepted a mortal body so he could reveal man’s immortality. Jesus accepted a man’s consciousness so he could fulfil the divine consciousness. Jesus accepted bodily pain so he could offer the world eternal joy. Jesus accepted betrayal so he could teach the world the meaning of forgiveness. <span id="more-2321"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jesus, the innocent child, took into his mind the darkness of the world and became Light. Jesus, the loving Son, took into his heart the suffering of the world and became Compassion. Jesus, the all-knowing Father, took upon his body the sins of the world and became Salvation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then he offered his human self, the agonized mind, the betrayed heart, the broken body at the Feet of God. And he offered his divine self-glowing Light, flowing Compassion, the world-Salvation at the feet of man.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jesus was the Cross: God’s Revelation and man’s Illumination.<br />
Jesus was the Crucifixion: God’s Self-fulfillment and man’s Self-discovery.<br />
Jesus was the Ascension: God’s Compassion-Love and man’s perfection-dawn.”</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">TWENTY-FIRST Century, the New Millennium! No more the old sorrows and joys-compendium. God&#8217;s Heart, God&#8217;s Eye, a new hope and a new promise! O run and dive and fly-Bliss, Infinity&#8217;s Bliss! The world shall cheer the road with a God-surrender-song. Creator&#8217;s Silence-Hearts, creation&#8217;s sound-lives throng.</p>

<p>Mountain-Silence are a group of female musicians from Switzerland, Austria and other surrounding countries. Over the past few years, they have extensively toured around Europe, offering concerts of spiritual music.</p>
<p>In their repertoire, they have recorded several songs, composed by Sri Chinmoy about the Saviour Jesus Christ. Some songs are based on quotations from the Bible, others songs are dedicated to Jesus Christ &#8211; either in Bengali or English.</p>

<p>Sri Chinmoy said of the Saviour Christ:</p>
<p><em>“As the beloved Son of God, Jesus Christ came into the world to become part and parcel of earth’s existence, and to transform its consciousness from human to divine. True, his mortal years numbered a mere thirty-three, but birthless and deathless is His immortal sacrifice for Heaven and earth.” [1]</em></p>
