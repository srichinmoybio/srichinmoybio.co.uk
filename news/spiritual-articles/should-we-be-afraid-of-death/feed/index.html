		<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t think so. Don&#039;t be afraid of anything...
.. I have been thinking over it, when do a man start to fear anything. it is NOT inborn, we all know. We were not afraid when we were children.

so is it necessary to be afraid of life and death..? i say the times we spent on scaring ourselves , should be used for gathering more knowledge and understanding about it, and accept it. 
and show that fear is an overrated thing.

that&#039;s what i do....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well stated article.

Although I respect other religions, I always feel that an approach that does not provide for Atheists or Agnostics is rather constrained to say the least. Surprising or not, even an Athiest beleives in the soul - they just dont beleive that there is an eternal bliss OR anything like a reincarnation. 

Death is frightening and no man can honestly deny this - a person can be around death, think of it, see it, give it - but they will always be afraid of their own eventual non-existence in the universe. 
The point is, that human kind has desperately (and rather skillfully) engineered tales, legends and stories to found the religious beleifs you refer to. The purpose of these beleifs is to comfort man against the most frightening prospect of all - his destruction. Man is so scared of his own non-existance, that he convinces himself of the religious stories he reads. He spreads the word, he obeys it obstinately and he will even kill for it. This is all in the desperate and rather unrealistic mission to make his dreams of salvation real. This, my friends, is religion.

So where is the comfort for Atheists? It takes a long time of thinking and rationalisation, but the comfort comes in a form that we all take for granted. Life itself. Human beings have been obsessed with making sense of their existence and living completely obsessive lives just to prolong life, that they have forgotten what is most important. Millions of sperm miss out on proper life. Millions of babies die. Thousands of children die. Millions of people die everyday around the world by mere accidents. Life is not promised and assured - it is something that has arisen by chance...

If you are reading this, you are a functioning human being (with the benefit of literacy) - you are blessed. You are not blessed by some &quot;god&quot; that will save you, you are blessed with the &quot;right now&quot; - something that billions upon billions of organisms miss the chance to have.

As for death? Without death life wouldn&#039;t quite be the same. I wouldn&#039;t be able to tell people out there that &quot;RIGHT NOW is a beautiful moment&quot; because it simply would be lying. The beauty of our existence is that it is limited. Think of it like a running race. Life is a 100 meter dash with the finish line in sight. You give it everything you&#039;ve got, everything this earthly body can give and the adrenaline and excitement is incredible. Life is not a long distance race where the end is not foreseeable - where people go slowly and try and &#039;preserve&#039; themselves.
This is how I view life anyway.

Death is your finish line, and you only have a short time - so give it everything you&#039;ve got, enjoy the time you have, and be thankful that you ever even got the chance to run :)]]></description>
