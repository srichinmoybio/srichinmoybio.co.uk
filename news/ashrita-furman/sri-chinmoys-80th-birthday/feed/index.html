		<description><![CDATA[At the very same time this was happening, I was busy at work with about 27 others on the cake to honor Sri Chinmoy&#039;s 80th birthday.  I&#039;m very sorry I missed this wonderful event, but want to thank all who happily participated.  Just great!!

And I want to thank whoever placed a left-over single garland on my door.  It was a very sweet gift to receive but no note as to who left this.  Gratitude......very happy to receive this small replica of the much larger significant one!!          All love,  Snehashila]]></description>
