<blockquote><p>“When it is a matter of my paintings, there is no mind, no form. Something within me is coming to the fore freely, effortlessly, with infinite inspiration…spreading its beauty and light so that my paintings flow spontaneously. When I paint, I try to go deep within to the source of creativity where it is all peace, calmness and quiet.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Sri Chinmoy Library, we have published some of the early volumes of AUM magazine. The first edition of AUM was published on 27th August 1965 &#8211; just over a year after Sri Chinmoy arrived in New York, US. The <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/periodicals/a">AUM magazines</a> contain a treasure of early talks, question and answers, poetry and discourses by Sri Chinmoy. The AUM magazines provided material for many of the first books published by Sri Chinmoy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next few months more editions of AUM magazine will be added to Sri Chinmoy Library.</p>
<p>The first talk in the AUM vol 1. No. 1. is on the subject of AUM</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;AUM is the soundless sound. It is the vibration of the Supreme. When one hears the soundless sound within, when one identifies oneself with it, when one lives within it, one can be freed from the fetters of ignorance and realise the Supreme within and without.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Right now fear, doubt, anxiety, tension and disharmony are reigning supreme. But there shall come a time when this world of ours will be flooded with peace. Who is going to bring about that radical change? It will be you: you and your sisters and brothers, who are an extension of your reality-existence. It will be you and your oneness-heart, which is spread throughout the length and breadth of the world. Peace is unity. Peace is oneness, within and without.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2450" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Jharna-Kala-undated-2-500x383.jpg" alt="Jharna-Kala-undated-2" width="500" height="383" /></p>
<p>A painting of Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>&#8220;Jharna-Kala&#8221; is the Bengali name Sri Chinmoy chose for his artwork. The English translation is &#8220;Fountain Art&#8221; &#8211; which signifies art flowing from the source of creation, flowing from the inspiration he receives in meditation.</p>
<p>He began painting on November 19th, 1974 in Ottawa, Canada. Over the next 33 years, Sri Chinmoy produced a prolific output of paintings.</p>
<p>One art critic commented on the paintings of Sri Chinmoy:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Instead of seeing the world as a concrete, solid body where things are separate, Sri Chinmoy sees the world as a unity where all things seem to move together. The paintings are physical manifestations of his inner meditations. They show a higher level of consciousness.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; T.J.Bergen, Secretary American Contemporary Artists Galleries.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a special display of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s lifting equipment were made available for public viewing in the prominent main station in Zurich.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2443" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/CHALLENGING-show-Zurich-2014-Sri-Chinmoy-500x281.jpg" alt="CHALLENGING-show-Zurich-2014-Sri-Chinmoy" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>Thousands of people passed the stand which was part of an exhibition on promoting good health. Within the display were 3 TV screens that featured weight-lifting videos and the famous documentary &#8220;Challenging Impossibility&#8221;. The exhibition is a travelling museum and has visited many cities around US and Europe. The exhibition shows the weightlifting machines that Sri Chinmoy used for hoisting immense weights with his  arms, legs and shoulders. This includes a staggering 2,600 lb standing calf raise, a unique apparatus for lifting individuals overhead, and a 800 lb bench press.  A gallery of photos and short films  documenting these extraordinary feats of strength completes the display.</p>

<p>The group performed a total of 15 performances in different locations ranging from short, spontaneous performances to full concerts of about 1 hour.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2433" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-10-08-at-14.05.03.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-08 at 14.05.03" width="378" height="254" /></p>
<p>Highlights of the tour included performing at Iona, Findhorn and the Hindu Temple in Glasgow during the Glasgow Mandir. The tour was often described by participants as a pilgrimage &#8211; the singers visited many of the famous holy sites of Scoltand &#8211; including ancient spiritual centres such as Whithorn, Kilmartin and Iona and more modern centres, such as  Findhorn and Gorbals Parish.</p>

<div data-canvas-width="180.581776" data-angle="0" data-font-name="Georgia">In Whithorn the group sang at the Abbey ruins and also at the site of &#8211; perhaps &#8211; the first Christian settlement in Scotland. It was by the sea and the weather was unusually very still and calm.</div>
