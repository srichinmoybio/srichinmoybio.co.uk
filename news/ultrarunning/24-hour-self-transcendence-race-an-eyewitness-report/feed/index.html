		<description><![CDATA[Hello

I had the pleasure of running the 24 hour race at tooting bec back in 1998 (i think). I covered just over 100 miles that day. Do you have any official records you can send me? I recall a 64 year old called Jeff who broke several age group world records. 

Many thanks    Alasdair]]></description>
