		<description><![CDATA[My Guru,
how I have missed your physical form, and now, it is gone in the impermanence of life. I Love you deeply, and know you have showen us that you are not the body, but far far beyond any limitation. Still, the human in me is pining for your presence. In my Heart I know it is there, perhaps more really now. My salutations to you for ever and ever. May your vision, grace and manifestation flow easily thru your children and the earth consciousnes. Gratitude beyond expression  to you. AUM Shanti Shanti Shanti...
Ranganath.]]></description>
