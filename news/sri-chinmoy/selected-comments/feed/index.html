		<description><![CDATA[These tributes really serve the divine, and personally help me to deal with Guru&#039;s passing.  A tribute mentioning the book &quot;Beyond Within&quot; reminds me of a very powerful experience.  I was reading the book and had such positive affirming emotions as I read it.  Everything seemed a new revelation.  I entered my bedroom after reading and noticed a green haze in the room.  I looked down to see that my chest was completely green from shoulder to shoulder and down to the navel in a emerald triangle of light. My body was transparent to the light emenating from my chest.  What do I do now? I looked at the light for some time , then sat and meditated on Guru&#039;s  picture. When I stopped the light was gone.  I was a brand new disciple and I am so grateful for this vision of the heart chakra and of many other divine experiences.  Love Prakash]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dearest Guru,
   I first saw your Transcendental picture at a meditation group at Uconn in 1971. After you accepted me that year You gave me the Blessingful opportunity to work with Brihaspati  to construct &quot;Beyond Within&quot;; and to produce radio programs on your philosophy. You have always given Your children the Light and Force to creatively manifest the Supreme. I&#039;m certain You will continue
to feed the aspiration of crying humanity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sri Chinmoy,
                      I was so grateful to thank you in person in Munich for helping me when you visited Cape Town. I had lost hope and you gave me hope.  Thank you for your friendship ,for putting your life down for the cause of Peace. Peace is not the absence of wars but a flood of love into the human family. You are that flood of love and may the peace that you radiated be reflected in the hearts of all those you have touched. The past is dust and my own gratitude heart is all that matters. Thank you for teaching me so much and enlightening me. Shanti Shanti Shanti]]></description>
