		<description><![CDATA[At the very end of the last Wednesday night meditation, on the eve of his passing Sri Chinmoy made the request that disciples who would like to could stay and  meditate that night from 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM. He then asked all those who would participate to walk past him, the count was 84 disciples would stay. He then stated that there would be enough time to return home  to get  blankets. His final words were &quot;Don&#039;t sleep&quot;.]]></description>
