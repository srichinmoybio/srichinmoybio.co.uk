		<description><![CDATA[I am so grateful to Sri Chinmoy that he has come to our country again.
I am his student for only one year and it was my first and last meeting with him on earth.. in my motherland Russia.. I saw him with my eyes, heard his voice and stood near him - it is greatest experience when you realize who he is.

I am grateful to all who have made this possible.

My heart is happy and full of gratitude tears.

Guru, You are forever in my heart.
And I continue my spiritual journey.]]></description>
