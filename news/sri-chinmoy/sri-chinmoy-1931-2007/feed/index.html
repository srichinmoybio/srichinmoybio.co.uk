		<description><![CDATA[I feel that the greatest tribute we can make to Sri Chinmoy is to read his writings and sing his songs; to pray and meditate regularly; to love ourselves and our lives a little more; to be sincerely happy and self-giving. A fitting tribute would be to take as much as we can from his teachings and example and live progressive spiritual lives making determined efforts to transcend our limitations. If we do this, I am sure it would make Sri Chinmoy feel that the 76 year effort he made for mankind was being truly appreciated and utilised - a fitting tribute, par excellence.
With gratitude,
Shardul.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I belonged to the sri Chimnoy group in Melbourne about !8 Years ago. I have sinced got married and my life has changed enormously.
I have alway carried with me the things I learned while I was with the group. 
I have only recently learned of his passing and it makes me very sad. My husband was never apart of the group but things i have passed on to him he has remembered and learned from.

Thankyou for helping me find the inner peace i was looking for.

		<description><![CDATA[Just a very small suggestion... I find that it would make more sense to number the tributes in the reverse order than what you have now. That way a tribute always has the same number associated with it rather than a changing number. Continue to display them in the same order as you do now.

		<description><![CDATA[I have, only just now, learned of my Master&#039;s passing.  

Kindly join me in offering a few moments of silent meditation in honor of our Beloved Sri Chinmoy. . .  

It is 5:52am on January 18th, 2008.  My name is Joseph Cerna.  I am an ex-disciple.  Although I officially left Sri Chinmoy&#039;s path many years ago. . .  I never actually felt, inwardly, that my inner connection to Sri Chinmoy had ever been severed.  To be clear, I left the path for personal reasons, not because I ever found fault in the path.   Sri Chinmoy&#039;s path was absolutely pure, innocent, and good.  That period of my life was the greatest time of my life.  I had the privilege to run with the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team holding the peace torch high, as we ran through Amarillo, Texas in 1999, I joyously spoke with my Guru, face to face, in Jamaica, Queens, New York at Aspiration Ground as he handed me a blessed ice cream sandwich, I helped to advertise throughout Manhattan for a Peace Concert Guru held in Central Park, and I meditated with Aklilu Gebrewold, the Center Leader, in Austin, Texas as a member of the Sri Chinmoy Meditation Club.  When the Buddha passed, he told Ananda, his greatest disciple, &quot;Do not weep for me, be a light unto your self.&quot;  I know that Guru would have had similar sentiments.  Guru was an Avatar.  God descended to Man-status.  He played the highest role a soul can play in the cosmic game of life.  He lived solely to benefit the whole of humanity with his divine consciousness and surrendered will to our Absolute Lord Beloved Supreme (God).  He was my Master.  He is my Master.  He will always be my Master.  A great light has been extinguished only in physical form.  For my beloved Guru, Sri Chinmoy, will never die.  His teachings, like his fellow Avatars, Jesus Christ and The Buddha, will live on forever.  As my Guru taught me, we are working with Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.  Death is just like walking from one room to another.  Guru, you are still alive in my heart and I will follow your teachings until the day, I too, return to my Absolute Lord Beloved Supreme.  I am happy that I took a trip to visit you on your birthday a few years ago, in which I just happened to be standing outside of Aspiration Ground at the entrance when you arrived sitting in the passenger seat of the car which had brought you.  And as you passed by me, with window down, only a few feet away from my face, you smiled and looked into my eyes with recognition and love.  With folded hands,  I, too, smiled as I mouthed, &quot;I love you Guru&quot;.  This moment, I will never forget.  I close this comment with an old Indian saying of which I feel Guru embodied perfectly, &quot;When you were born you cried and the world rejoiced, live your life in such a manner, that when you die, the world cries. . .  and you rejoice.&quot;

You will be missed, but never forgotten.  We love you Chinmoy Kumar Ghose, Sri Chinmoy, our beloved teacher, friend, and Master.  Good-bye Guru.  

Good-bye.]]></description>
