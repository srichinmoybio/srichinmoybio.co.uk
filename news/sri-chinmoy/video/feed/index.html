		<description><![CDATA[Many many thanks for posting this beautiful tribute to Sri Chinmoy.  I&#039;ve listened to it many times and each time reveals the beauty of both Gary Ackerman and the influence our beloved Master had on people. Now Sri Chinmoy lives in Spirit in all of us who have been touched by Him and whose lives have been inspired by His words and actions.  Gratitude ! The world needs more Gary Ackerman; like him, let us transcend our barriers and reach for the Oneness Goal that Sri Chinmoy gave His life for.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this most wonderful video for those who could not be in attendance.  It has truly brought some closure.

Thank you very much to Congressman Gary Ackerman for his beautiful words and reflection of one of God&#039;s greatest gifts to mankind.

Also thank you to the family, friends, and followers of Sri Chinmoy, who loves this great man and believes in the life he lived on earth.  We are all very blessed to have had him in our lives by whatever role he played.

And most certainly, this goes without saying but cannot be said enough, thank you Sri Chinmoy for being a living inspiration as His expression.  It brings me great joy to know that you are in a much deserving, loving, eternal place.

I will see someday

Glory be to God]]></description>
