		<description><![CDATA[Thank you all for accepting and making a home for his
teaching. The teaching remains, if all I can do is read,
I will. However far it will allow me to take it, let it be.
May the Guru’s teaching flourish in the
garden of our hearts. Peace and Peace again…

		<description><![CDATA[I missed the 60’s because of too much busy-ness,
and now in my 60’s the fisherman has leavt his hook.
Thank you all for accepting and making a home for his
teaching. The teaching remains, if all I can do is read,
I will. However far it will allow me to take it, let it be.
I regret never to have heard his words spoken, but I am
greatful he brought them here to say. I am indeed
fortunate. May the Guru’s teaching flourish in the
garden of our hearts. Peace and Peace again…]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my retirement, I finally got around to rereading one of Sri Chinmoy&#039;s books  titled Heart II.  Endeavoring to 
find further reading, I subsequently have found to my
immeasurable loss, the passing of the Guru of the Great
Lineage  whose effort, it seems, was to translate in
Western terms the enormous depth the eastern mind has archived and practiced for centuries. At the same
time, there was no question in my mind that this task,
as others taken by Sri Chinmoy was adeptly accomp-
lished in the grasp by his students of this teaching.  I missed the 60&#039;s because of too much busy-ness,
and now in my 60&#039;s the fisherman has leavt his hook. 
Thank you all for accepting and making a home for his
