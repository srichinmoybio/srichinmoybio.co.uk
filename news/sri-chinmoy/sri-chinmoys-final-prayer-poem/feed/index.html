		<description><![CDATA[Sri Chinmoy will be sadly missed by his disciples and anyone whose heart he has touched. Through his spiritual teachings, he has made us aware of our Supreme, our God and our inner pilot who are one and the same.

He ranks among the greatest spiritual teachers that have ever graced this earth.

He has recently been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, which in our opinion, he has earned many times over for his good works toward achieving lasting peace in the world.

He will live for ever in the hearts of his disciples and will continue to be concerned about our spiritual well
being as he has promised.]]></description>
