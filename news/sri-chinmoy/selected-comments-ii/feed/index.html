		<description><![CDATA[I was struck by one of Guru&#039;s poems on the back of Mahavishnu&#039;s albums many years ago.  &quot;Above the toil of life, my soul is a bird of fire winging the infinite.&quot;   Who is this? I thought.  And when the group performed at Winterland in San Francisco I went to see the  Mahavishnu Orchestra,  After seeing many concerts there, the group seemed at a new level of consciousness I had never seen before from any music group.  They were so pure and spirtual with a great deal of passion and intensity.  Fast forward a few years later. I was a new disciple and running with another disciple in the foothills of Los Gatos, California.   It was a perfect day with 70 mile visibility. This day I had run higher before into the hills at some effort to a seminary overlooking the Santa Clara Valley.  On an expansive lawn we stopped and rested. I put my arm across my eyes for a moment and saw a point of blue light on the left side of my screen of vision and was immediately attracted to it.  It was a bright blue light in the shape of a bird!  With my eyes closed I watched as it glided across from left to right, getting larger as it neared the center and smaller as it flew off to the right.  It had very large wings, like an albatross, and seemed to be soaring on an ambrosial breeze.

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Guru,
I was graced by your initiation in 1973, and will forever be grateful. You have changed my life, saved my life, really - in countless ways, seen and unseen.  I have almost daily felt your Presence, your influence, your inspiration, your help. Early this summer in looking for songs of inspiration to perform at the local Vedanta Center where I live in Massachusetts, I happened upon some music tracks by  Srinvantu, of which I was a member thirty years ago. I was immediately awash in tears of deep joy and gratitude. I remembered the melodies and sometimes every word of Your songs, ones we used to sing in the competitions, in times that I will treasure always, those years that were beautiful dreams. I cried every time I played or sang your music after that. Since then I have sung several of Your songs for kirtans and meditations, and these have always been very graciously received by the Vedanta Center members. In fact, it was during one of their ceremonies that I heard the news of Your Mahasamadhi - and I was so powerfully moved, on behalf of the disciples, my brothers and sisters for whom I felt such sadness - and because of my gratitude for Your bringing me so close before your passing from this world; another proof of  Your Love and Compassion. I remember You as the manifestation of those qualities, and of genius; and as the unimaginable height of Consciousness. 
Thank You, Guru. My whole life bows to You, is a song of gratitude to You - for sharing of Yourself, for coming to offer Your help, appreciated or not by this world; and really for giving us all a chance to sample the Nectar of Bliss, to inspire us all to go beyond our limitations, always.  Namaste.]]></description>
