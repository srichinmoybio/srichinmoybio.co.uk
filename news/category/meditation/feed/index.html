				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every Christmas, Sri Chinmoy used to travel with his students to different countries on a Christmas retreat, a tradition his students still honour today. Noivedya Juddery gives an account of his retreat experience in Indonesia.<span id="more-1980"></span></p>
<div style="width: 627px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " alt="Kettledrum - 20 January 2013_Page_2_Image_0002" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Kettledrum-20-January-2013_Page_2_Image_0002.jpg" width="617" height="503" /><p class="wp-caption-text">As well as meditation functions 3 times a day, the location offered opportunities for running, swimming, table tennis and other leisure activities.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left">The Indonesian island of Bintan, a short ferry ride from Singapore, is the kind of palm-lined tropical paradise where many people (including some Australians and many Singaporeans) can escape from the busy urban world. For the bulk of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s students, who prefer their travels to be exciting rather than restful, it might not seem to be the most obvious destination. While the island is charming, and the people are sweet and friendly, it is not clearly immersed in spirituality like Bali, or the site of brilliant landmarks like Yangon. However, like Pangkor Island, the relaxing world of Bintan is perhaps an ideal Christmas Trip location. Directly outside the hotel, there is little to distract us from the reason that we are there: not as tourists, but as spiritual aspirants, fortunate to be on a dynamic and versatile Path of the Heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Mind you, within the resort, there is plenty to keep us busy. Beautiful running trails, surrounded by green forest. Energetic beach activities. A buffet restaurant serving a variety of dishes on par with some of the best food from any Christmas Trip. In case we find ourselves indulging in the meals too much – a perfectly reasonable vice – we are lucky in that we enjoy sporting activities more than other spiritual people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="races" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/races.jpg" width="600" height="205" /><p class="wp-caption-text">There were mens&#8217; and womens&#8217; 1 and 2 mile races every week as well as a swim-run race</p></div>
<p>The evenings, as always, offered theatrical productions of spiritual stories, a highlight of which was a 20-minute dramatisation by Abhinabha (from the Netherlands) of Sri Chinmoy’s story <em>The Scholar and the Thief</em>. Theatre people often suffer for their art, and Abhinabha was no exception, dislocating his shoulder during a particularly vigorous rehearsal the night before. Fortunately, as one of the cast, I can honestly say that it was all worth it. (Then again, I didn’t dislocate my shoulder.) The night had already delivered a few surprises in the play-world, with Satyakarma’s short play starting with the usual craziness, then ascending to become perhaps the most soulful play of the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="width: 290px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img alt="yoga" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/yoga.jpg" width="280" height="325" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Amalendu, a qualified yoga instructor, offered yoga classes every morning for his fellow students</p></div>
<p>However many hundreds of plays have now been performed at Christmas Trips, there is no end to the embellishments of Sri Chinmoy’s tales. This was never more obvious than on Improv Night, organised by Sadadand, in which the entire audience was split into teams and given 20 minutes to perform one of Guru’s stories, with certain rules (such as the presence of the line “We all live in a yellow submarine”&#8230; well, naturally). Some of the results &#8212; such as a girls’ play that was mostly a cross between a dream sequence and a Russian ballet, and another in which Susebika (Auckland) hilariously interrupted the story by dancing around and cheerfully repeating “We all live in a yellow submarine!” for no discernible reason (apart from the rules) &#8212; had to be seen to be believed. In fact, I saw them, and I’m still not convinced I believe them. But despite (or because of) the lack of preparation time, pure entertainment was the order of the evening.</p>
<p>Also in Bintan, Hridayinee gave a soulful (but regal) performance in her own play, Grahak added another pirate play to their continuing adventures, and Prachar gave a talk (not a play) in which he named three things that he has learned on Guru’s Path… but the first of those was “I know nothing”, so we can’t be sure about the rest.</p>
<p>As I write this, we still have a few days to enjoy Bintan – though for the next two days, most students will be across the water in Singapore for the World Harmony Run and the Music of the Heart concert. For now, we enjoy the sunshine and greenery of a meditative paradise, with the smiles of the Indonesian people to make us feel at home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Auckland, New Zealand, members of the Sri Chinmoy Centre have been offering free meditation workshops for a variety of local businesses.</p>
<div id="attachment_1777" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1777 " title="meditation-mountain" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/meditation-mountain1.jpg" alt="meditation" width="500" height="375" /><p class="wp-caption-text">You don&#8217;t need to go to the mountains to learn how to meditate.</p></div>
<p>Jogyata Dallas from Auckland writes about this new project:</p>
<p>An interesting and very encouraging development in the Sri Chinmoy Centre in Auckland, New Zealand, has been our growing involvement in offering free meditation workshops to large businesses and institutions – hospitals, banks, television studios, insurance companies, manufacturing warehouses, even beauty salons! An offer in our usual ‘Learn Meditation’ flier to provide an instructor who will introduce the ABCs of meditation and stress management ‘at your place of work’, and in any suitable lunchtime or morning session, is attracting a growing response.</p>
<p>In one Auckland medical centre I was asked by the director how they could maintain this new skill and incorporate meditation into the very stressful lives of their employees. I suggested, without much hope that this would happen, that they set aside a dedicated meditation room or ‘peace’ room and meet several times weekly. The suggestion was enthusiastically welcomed and I have since learnt that this program is now very much alive. I gave them some of<a href="www.radiosrichinmoy.org/sri-chinmoy/"> Sri Chinmoy’s music</a>, his main book on meditation and a clutch of my favorite incense – new friendships forged!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At an international beauty clinic where we gave a one hour lunchtime workshop, the fifteen women were so pleased with their feeling of an uncharacteristic inner peace that they presented me with a large box of beauty products! – hair restoratives (the only item of real interest!), expensive skin tonics,  a slew of shampoos and revitalizers. My popularity among the women members of our Centre shot up overnight when I distributed these the following day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1778" title="beauty-products" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/beauty-products.jpg" alt="beauty products" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week I was invited to introduce meditation to a group of lawyers on the 35<sup>th</sup> floor of a corporate tower. We all enjoyed ourselves, we were all inspired!  Human beings have their fundamental spirituality in common, even where our choice of lifestyle or profession takes us into such divergent worlds of experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like to remind people how special they are to even have an interest or curiosity in meditation – a very significant time in our evolution, as though the soul is stirring after a long time of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do like this outreach program very much – the consequences are immeasurable but profound, the ripples of positive change spreading out into time and space and  touching countless, multiplying lives with the perennial message of awakening.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent interview, Ashrita Furman, a student of Sri Chinmoy, explains how the practise of meditation helped him in his spiritual journey and setting a wide range of Guinness World Records.</p>

<p>When Ashrita was young, he admits he was not good at sport, in fact he mentions he was &#8216;a bit of nerd&#8217;. But, after practising meditation for several years, Sri Chinmoy saw Ashrita had the potential to aim for a big mileage in a 24 hour cycle race. To Ashrita&#8217;s surprise he was able to ride 405 miles in 24 hours, with little training &#8211; displaying to himself how techniques of meditation and mantra can help us to transcend our previous limitations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Members of the Sri Chinmoy Centre frequently give free meditation classes in cities around the world, our online meditation guide can give a few insights into the practise of meditation.</p>

<p>&#8230;.Begin by thinking of meditation as a journey – your own abiding happiness is the goal. If you are ready to begin this journey, then the guidelines in the following pages will greatly help you – and now is the best time to start&#8230;.</p>
<h4>What is Meditation?</h4>
<p>Sri Chinmoy writes that meditation is the tool to try and reach a higher state of consciousness &#8211; A realm beyond the domain of thought.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; When we meditate, we do not think at all. The aim of meditation is to free ourselves from all thought. Thought is like a dot on a blackboard. Whether it is good or bad, it is there. Only if there is no thought whatsoever can we grow into the highest reality.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Chinmoy gives several practical ways to keep the mind silent during meditation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/guatemala.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1062 aligncenter" title="guatemala" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/guatemala.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>What can we do about thoughts on a practical level? Let us take thoughts  as individuals and take the mind as a room that we live in and own. We  have to bolt the door to our mind-room from the inside and not allow  anybody whatsoever to enter. We will not only keep out our enemies,  which are bad thoughts, but also our friends, the good thoughts. We are  determined to enjoy only silence, complete silence.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1061-1' id='fnref-1061-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1061)'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>Another technique Sri Chinmoy encourages is to use the power of the heart rather than the mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>How will you make the mind calm and quiet? The mind has its own power,  and right now this power is stronger than your present eagerness and  determination to meditate. But if you can get help from your heart, then  gradually you will be able to control your mind. The heart, in turn,  gets constant assistance from the soul, which is all light and all  power.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy &#8211; <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1061-2' id='fnref-1061-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1061)'>2</a></sup></p>
<p><span id="more-1061"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>My mind,<br />
Keep your thoughts silent.<br />
Keep your words silent.<br />
Keep everything that you have<br />
And you are silent<br />
To make me and my heart<br />
Extremely happy.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1061-3' id='fnref-1061-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1061)'>3</a></sup></p>
