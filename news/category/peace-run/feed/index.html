<blockquote><p>Right now fear, doubt, anxiety, tension and disharmony are reigning supreme. But there shall come a time when this world of ours will be flooded with peace. Who is going to bring about that radical change? It will be you: you and your sisters and brothers, who are an extension of your reality-existence. It will be you and your oneness-heart, which is spread throughout the length and breadth of the world. Peace is unity. Peace is oneness, within and without.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday 17th May, the city of Leeds was re-dedicated as a Sri Chinmoy Peace-Blossom, during a ceremony attended by the Mayor of Leeds and members of the Peace Run who are travelling through England.</p>
<p>Leeds was initially dedicated as a Peace City in 1995 on United Nations day, 24th October 1995. This May, the Sri Chinmoy Peace Run is travelling through England and up to Scotland as part of the European Peace Run. With the run passing through Leeds, the city of Leeds kindly agreed to make a new plaque and honour the Peace Run.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2380" alt="peace-run-team-backdrop-leeds" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/peace-run-team-backdrop-leeds-500x375.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>The Lord Mayor of Leeds Councillor Tom Murray unveiled the plaque and spoke welcoming the runners and affirming the city of Leeds&#8217; commitment to diversity, tolerance and the promotion of peace. <span id="more-2378"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2381" alt="mayor-torch" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/mayor-torch.jpg" width="450" height="315" /></p>
<p>The Lord Mayor of Leeds and his wife Edna.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2379" alt="plaque" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/plaque1-500x375.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>The plaque reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A world of peace and harmony has been humanity&#8217;s dream since time immemorial. Today Leeds joins hundreds of communities throughout the world dedicated to the cause of peace and international friendship. Other such Peace Blossoms include the cities of Ottawa, Canberra, Auckland, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Reykavik and natural wonders such as the Niagara Falls and the Matterhorn.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A Sri Chinmoy Peace Blossom is a beacon of inspiration, to promote a strong sense of world family among people. It takes its name from Sri Chinmoy, an ambassador for peace who committed his life to the pursuit of world harmony. Leeds has long been home to people of many different cultures and believes. Through its status as a Nuclear Free Local Authority, it has worked to free the world of the the of nuclear annihilation. The peace loving people of Leeds are proud to honour our city&#8217;s historic commitment to peace and join our vibrant and graceful city with the global family of Sri Chinmoy Peace Blossoms.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In dedicating Leeds as a Peace City on the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we register our hopes for the day when nations may work together in peace and people may live together in harmony.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Leeds City Council, United Nations Day, 24th October 1995.</p>
<p>&#8220;O dreamers of peace, come. Let us walk together. O lovers of peace, come. Let us run together. O servers of peace, come. Let us grow together.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 10th, 2014, representatives from around the world joined together to set a new Guinness World Record for reciting a poem into the most number of languages &#8211; 203. The poem by Sri Chinmoy on peace was recited by more than fifty UN ambassadors, diplomats and Olympians; these distinguished guests joined with Guinness top record holder Ashrita Furman, and participants of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run.</p>

<p>The Guinness Record Poem written by Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;O dreamers of peace, come.<br />
Let us walk together.<br />
O lovers of peace, come.<br />
Let us run together.<br />
O servers of peace, come.<br />
Let us grow together.”</p>
<div id="attachment_2365" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-2365" alt="Ashrita Furman announces record" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/CKG-Mr-Guinness-Ashrita-Furman-announces-new-record-photo-by-JD-Guthier-9020-500x333.jpg" width="500" height="333" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ashrita Furman announces record</p></div>
<p>The 206 languages ranged from Bengali and Maori to Newari and Zulu, it meant that the poem “O Dreamers of Peace” was expressed with some of the most unusual and charming communication sounds on the globe. The record was set during the launch of the global biennial Peace Run held at the Dag Hammarsköld Plaza across from UN Headquarters in New York City. It was here that Peace Run founder Sri Chinmoy led the Peace Meditation at the United Nations twice a week for 37 years. Ashrita said he wanted to break a Guinness Record this week in honour of the Golden Jubilee 50th Anniversary of the arrival in America of Sri Chinmoy 50 years ago.</p>
<div id="attachment_2366" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-2366" alt="CKG-Amb-Chowdhury-of-Bangladesh-by-Apaguha-Vesely-0718" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/CKG-Amb-Chowdhury-of-Bangladesh-by-Apaguha-Vesely-0718-500x333.jpg" width="500" height="333" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Amb. Anwarul Chowdhury from Bangladesh</p></div>
<p>The Peace Run and Guinness Record were highlighted by long-time UN Under-Secretary-General Amb. Anwarul Chowdhury, a long-time friend and countryman of Sri Chinmoy, who said: “This Peace Run symbolises the aspirations of all of us for world friendship and global peace and was founded by Sri Chinmoy in 1987—a visionary of peace and a person who believed in the oneness of humanity.”</p>
<p><span id="more-2363"></span></p>
<p>Ashrita has been working on organising the world record non-stop for months. “The greatest challenges are in finding translators for languages which are spoken only by a few thousand people. For example, Bislama is only spoken by 6200 people in Vanuatu and New Caledonia,” he said.. Ashrita Furman has set over 500 Guinness World Records, including the record for the most Guinness records. The record set today is for the Guinness world record for “A Poem / Literary Passage Recited in the Most Languages“.</p>

<h3>Begin of American Peace Run</h3>
<p>The Guinness World Record attempt also coincided with the start of the North American Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run. The Peace Run will travel 12,000 miles in the next four months as it travels through the US and Canada.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.peacerun.org">Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run</a>, formerly known as World Harmony Run, is a global torch relay that symbolises humanity&#8217;s universal aspiration for a more peaceful world and involves world leaders and millions of citizens every other year.</p>

<p>President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy lit the Peace Torch in Brussels to mark the beginning of the 2014 run <a href="http://www.peacerun.org/be/news/2014/0211/">(Link)</a></p>
<p>Mr. Van Rompuy said on the opening day “<em>Establishing, maintaining and developing peace is an ongoing run, an ongoing battle. (…) So thank you for everything you are doing to bring people closer together. You are proving to us that taking part in this Run is not just exercise or sport. It is, I insist on it, a way of life.”</em></p>

<p>The Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run was founded in 1987 by peace visionary, Sri Chinmoy. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s time in the West, and remains a powerful vehicle for spreading peace throughout thousands of individuals around the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is no human being on earth<br />
Who does not have the capacity<br />
To offer the message of peace<br />
To the world at large.<br />
But what is needed now<br />
Is the soulful willingness. <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/ap-18991">1</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home peace run is currently travelling through the great continent of Africa. The run has already visited South Africa, Ethiopia and Zambia, and in coming weeks, the Peace Run team will visit countries, such as Zimbabwe, Kenya, Burundi and Ruwanda. A full itinerary can be viewed here &#8211; <a href="http://www.peacerun.org/fa/">Africa Peace Run</a></p>
<p>The Peace Run team comprises international volunteers from Africa and around the world; the aim of the run is to spread the ideals of friendship, peace and harmony. It provides a dynamic way for people to share their aspirations for peace and a better world. Young and old have already enthusiastically embraced the Peace Run as it makes its way around Africa.</p>

<p>A great feature of the Peace Run is the spontaneous meetings. Many people see the flaming torch and join in for a while, as the run passes by the side of the road.<span id="more-2285"></span><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2289" alt="zambia-31-october" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/zambia-31-october.jpg" width="450" height="253" /></p>
