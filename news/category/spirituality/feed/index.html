				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Members of the Auckland Sri Chinmoy Centre have embraced a global initiative to promote happiness through offering books, posters and meditation workshops on the theme of happiness.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2143" alt="happiness" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Happiness-15.jpg" width="500" height="356" /></p>
<p>With the topic of happiness much in the news &#8211; and increasingly relevant in a world where, by 2020, depression is being identified as the probable second leading cause of disability worldwide – it is reassuring to see a number of global efforts to address this issue.</p>
<p><span id="more-2142"></span></p>
<p>The UN General Assembly passed a resolution to have March 20<sup>th</sup> every year designated as the <b><i>International Day of Happiness</i></b>. The United Nations also mandated a <b><i>World</i></b> <b><i>Happiness Report</i></b> which the Earth Institute of Columbia University prepared. This report shows the state of happiness in countries around the world and reflects a growing and worldwide demand for a more “holistic approach to development” aimed at promoting sustainable happiness and wellbeing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United Nations has asked the world community to support this initiative to encourage and foster happier societies. At Harvard University the most popular course is on ‘Happiness’ with over 800 students enrolled!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2144" alt="happiness" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Happiness-11.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p>The Sri Chinmoy Centres worldwide are also responding. A ‘Happiness’ project includes the audio book ‘The Jewels of Happiness’ &#8211; featuring Sri Chinmoy’s writings on the subject read by seventeen famous people – played  by radio stations and often including live interviews with project organizers.  Inspirational ‘Happiness’ posters have also been designed for schools, businesses and community centres to lift everyone’s spirits. These feature quotations on happiness from the writings of Sri Chinmoy and are freely available in many participating countries.</p>
<p>The Sri Chinmoy Centres in many places are also offering stress-reducing, happiness-themed, free  ‘learn meditation’ workshops at businesses and places of work. These structured courses introduce key meditation techniques and workplace skills that deal with the topic of inner happiness and have proven very popular throughout the five years this free service has been running.</p>
<p>Children, our most precious resource, are also being encouraged to live happy lives, and music programs are being developed to foster a little joyfulness in schools. Children love to sing, and ‘Jewels of Happiness’ author Sri Chinmoy &#8211; a prolific composer – wrote a number of songs about happiness that have been compiled into a booklet , ‘Sing Happiness’.  Music teachers are being invited  to encourage children’s classroom joy by introducing these simple songs.</p>

<p>In this universal spirit of religion, Sri Chinmoy wrote that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am deeply proud to be here at the Universalist Church, for my heart voices forth the truth that the religion which is universal is the core of all religions, and the realisation of the universal religion is not the monopoly of any particular man. Any individual, irrespective of caste, creed and nationality, can have the realisation of this universal religion if he has dynamic imagination, creative inspiration and fulfilling aspiration to assimilate the spirit of all religions.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Festival of the Heart is an event to be held in Melbourne, November 2012; it will seek to explore how we can use &#8216;heart-power&#8217; to improve the well-being of the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-11-at-18.07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845" title="world-festival-of-the-heart" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-11-at-18.07.jpg" alt="world-festival-of-the-heart" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy has a very famous and much quoted aphorism:</p>
<blockquote><p>“When the power of love replaces the love of power, man will have a new name: God.” [1]</p></blockquote>
<p>In an explanation of this, Sri Chinmoy elaborated by saying that here ‘God’ means universality.</p>
<p>He said that when we use the power of love, individuality immediately disappears and is replaced by universality or a positive feeling of oneness; however when we use the love of power, we feel separate and superior, feelings that very often lead to destruction.</p>
<p>Using this deeply insightful and meaningful ideal to build upon, the <strong><em>World Festival of the Heart, </em></strong>an event to be staged in Melbourne, Australia in November this year, was born. The Festival is a gathering of luminaries across the fields of spirituality, science and the arts, to celebrate their wisdom and life achievements, and to collectively explore how we can use “heart-power” to improve the fundamental wellbeing of all life on our planet.</p>
<p>Our world is standing on the brink of a new era and all around us we are witnessing a thrilling convergence of these three amazing fields of endeavour. Festival organisers are planning a three-day program that will explore this “convergence” and the possibilities it holds to change our lives in unimaginable ways.</p>
<p>Festival organisers are creating a program full of activities: workshops, music, dialogue, devotions, performance, concerts, an expo and a grand forum. The program is designed for anyone who has a passion for life, for the world and our future. Themes for Festival participants to explore will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Great Mystery: life, consciousness and the universe</li>
<li>The Universal Heart: recognising the oneness in diversity of all life</li>
<li>Creative Living: using heart-power for a healthy, happy and harmonious life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further information and contact details for the Festival can be found at <strong><a href="http://www.festivaloftheheart.org/">www.festivaloftheheart.org</a>.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Chinmoy says of death:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">“What is death? Death is the immortal pilgrim&#8217;s short rest along the road of Eternity. Death is a necessary experience for human beings at the present state of their evolving consciousness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span class="copyright">Excerpt from <em>My Rose Petals, Part 3</em> by <a href="/index_html">Sri Chinmoy</a>.</span></p>
<p>Death is the journey into the unknown. Death means the end of our physical body; to some people this feels like the end of life. However, the Seer Poets have suggested that we are not the body but spirit. If we can have an identity with our inner self then we will lose our fear of death. Death becomes instead merely a process of transition from one stage of life to the next.</p>
<blockquote><p>On the day I die, when I&#8217;m being<br />
carried toward the grave, don&#8217;t weep.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t say, &#8220;He&#8217;s gone! He&#8217;s gone!&#8221;<br />
Death has nothing to do with going away.</p>
<p>The sun sets and the moon sets,<br />
but they&#8217;re not gone. Death<br />
is a coming together.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Rumi (1)</p>
<p>To overcome a feeling of death we need to cultivate a sense of spiritual identity. If we live only in the mind and intellect we will always be sceptical about the spiritual life. The intellect has its purpose and benefits, but the mind also has its limitations. To discover our real self we need to transcend the mind and dive deep into our spiritual heart, where our soul abides. If we can learn to meditate and quieten the mind we will become aware of a powerful inner reality. This embodies a consciousness more illumining and real than our ordinary mental awareness. We may not be able to prove this to others; it is something we can only experience for ourselves. Through meditation if we can feel a real and abiding peace then we will feel the soul is a living reality and not a mental hallucination. The lofty inspirations of the Seer poets will resonate with our inner realisations.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Death is but changing of our robes to wait<br />
In wedding garments at the Eternal&#8217;s gate.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Aurobindo (2)</p>
<p>In the west the concept of reincarnation does not have widespread belief. However in Buddhist and Hindu traditions reincarnation is an integral part of their philosophy. The idea of reincarnation is that the human soul needs to experience many different experiences before it is able to achieve liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Reincarnation enables the human soul to gain experiences, through which it can make spiritual progress.</p>
<p>Nothing on earth is permanent. The only certainties in life are that all creatures must die and pass away. Death is as natural as birth; why should we fear that which is perfectly natural and inevitable? That which gives us life also takes away life. But here death only means the extinction of the body. The soul merely passes from one body to another. For the soul life is immortal, death has no meaning. This is the message of the Upanishads, as Sri Chinmoy says</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Before death, life is a seeker.<br />
After death, the same life becomes a dreamer.<br />
Before death, life struggles and strives for Perfection.<br />
After death, the same life rests<br />
and enjoys the divine Bliss with the soul.&#8221; (3)</p></blockquote>
