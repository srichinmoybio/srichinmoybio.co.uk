<p>When Ashrita was young, he admits he was not good at sport, in fact he mentions he was &#8216;a bit of nerd&#8217;. But, after practising meditation for several years, Sri Chinmoy saw Ashrita had the potential to aim for a big mileage in a 24 hour cycle race. To Ashrita&#8217;s surprise he was able to ride 405 miles in 24 hours, with little training &#8211; displaying to himself how techniques of meditation and mantra can help us to transcend our previous limitations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ashrita Furman recently set a new Guinness World Record for walking in the heaviest shoes, another unique feat of self-transcendence from the person who holds the most current Guinness World Records. The record was part of Guinness&#8217; annual &#8211; Guinness World Records day. Previous records include challenging events such as the most consecutive forward rolls &#8211; a rather nauseous 12 miles, and the longest continuous distance whilst balancing milk bottle &#8211; 80 miles .</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/ashrita-campo3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-923 alignleft" style="margin: 5px;" title="ashrita-campo3" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/ashrita-campo3.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>In a recent article at the Wall Street Journal, Ashrita explains his inspiration for feats of self-transcendence come from his meditation and spiritual teacher  Sri Chinmoy. Though unathletic at school, Ashrita found a new source of energy and athleticism after practising yoga and meditation under the tutelage of Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want to inspire people,&#8221; says Mr. Furman, who is almost always  training for three or four events. &#8220;If you have a dream, you can achieve  your dream. I&#8217;m living my dream.&#8221; &#8211; Ashrita at Wall Street Journal</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>August 27, 2009</em>. On the occasion of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s birth anniversary, New Yorker Ashrita Furman unveiled the world&#8217;s largest lollipop with a weight of 6,706 pounds (3041 kg). It surpasses the previous Guinness World Record for a giant lollipop by almost 2,000 pounds (907 kg). Ashrita Furman, holder of the most Guinness records, was the architect behind the feat accompanied by an international team of over 25 assistants.</p>
<div id="attachment_403" style="width: 288px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-403" title="World's Largest Lollipop_by Jowan Gauthier" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Worlds-Largest-Lollipop_by-Jowan-Gauthier-300x187.jpg" alt="World's Largest Lollipopr" width="278" height="173" /><p class="wp-caption-text">World&#39;s Largest Lollipop  - Photo by Jowan Gauthier</p></div>
<p>The 6,706 pound (3041 kg) lollipop is 10 feet (3 m) in diameter and 10 inches (25 cm) thick. The huge red candy is made of sugar and corn syrup, which was melted in hundred 100-gallon (380 litre) pots. Including the stick it has the height of 25 feet (7.50 m). This size ensures Ashrita Furman a new entry into the Guinness Book, because the previous largest lollipop was 4,759 pounds (2158 kg).</p>
<p><span id="more-401"></span></p>
<p>To put it in perspective this single lollipop would be the equivalent of <strong>165,070</strong> regular-sized lollipops!</p>
<div id="attachment_409" style="width: 209px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-409" title="World's Largest Lollipop_Close-Up_by Jowan Gauthier" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Worlds-Largest-Lollipop_Close-Up_by-Jowan-Gauthier.jpg" alt="Ashrita at work - Photo by Jowan Gauther" width="199" height="133" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ashrita at work - Photo by Jowan Gauther</p></div>
<p>Created in his Queens, New York neighborhood, the giant lollipop was hoisted into the air briefly on Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s birth anniversary, August 27th, 2009.  Onlookers included some of the 1,500 visitors from 50 countries gathered in New York to observe Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s birth anniversary. The lollipop&#8217;s colourful happy birthday message to Sri Chinmoy together with a reproduction of one of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s soul bird drawings came into view as the lollipop lifted into the air.</p>
<p>In honour of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s birthday, Ashrita dedicated the record to the late philosopher, poet and athlete who inspired him and humanity with his weightlifting world records and the World Harmony Run. &#8220;We know Sri Chinmoy for his compassion, kindness and sweetness and for that reason we are celebrating his birthday by making the largest lollipop,&#8221; commented Ashrita.</p>

<p>Ashrita has set Guinness World Records on Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s birthday on several occasions. In 2005 and 2008, he set a record for the most lit candles on a cake. In 2007, he dedicated the world&#8217;s largest pencil to Sri Chinmoy. 2006 saw the creation of the largest popcorn sculpture and in 2004 he set a record for the largest flower bouquet.</p>

<p>Ashrita Furman recently set an impressive landmark for setting his 100th simultaneous Guiness World Record. Over the past 30 years, Ashrita has been fascinated with Guinness world Records and has set over 230 official Guinness Records. With his recent record attempt he now has 100 current Guinness records.</p>
<p>The Record was set in City Hall Park in Manhattan on April 14th. It was the record for reciting a poem in the most number of languages. The previous record was 79 languages, but, with help from friends in the Sri Chinmoy Centre, Ashrita set a new record of 111 languages. Ashrita read the Poem, Precious Beyond Measure, in Zulu. Speaking of the record, Ashrita said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was fun learning about many of these languages &#8211; quite a few I never even heard of,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Councilman, Jimmy Genero spoke about the record and said how appropriate it was to set the record in New York, which is renowned for its cultural diversity.</p>

<p>Ashrita talks about his Guiness Record breaking journey and what helps him break over 221 records &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;.After breaking the ice by jumping on a pogo stick while jumping rope, Furman discussed how he transformed from the nerd to one of the most versatile athletes today.</p>
<p>The son of a successful attorney growing up in Kew Gardens Hills, Furman came to the realization that there was more to life than having a nice family and a big house. He started studying eastern philosophy and began meditating on his own, but shortly met up with Chinmoy. Their idea of meditating originally clashed. Furman wanted to go into a cave and drink strange teas, while Chinmoy was a strong advocate of physical activity&#8230;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Ashrita Furman set two new Guinness World Records in Edinburgh taking his number of current world records to 88. </p>
<p>The 54-year-old &#8211; managed to catch 51 malteasers in one minute – smashing the previous entry of 41 To make the record more fun, Ashrita decided to strap a Maltese dog to his back. The idea was to attempt the record by the statue of Bobby at Greyfriars. But, the lcey condition meant Ashrita&#8217;s helper was too cold throwing the maltesers, so the record was set inside a sports hall. Ashrita said, the key to breaking this record and the grape record was the power of concentration. </p>
<p>A couple of years ago, Ashrita set record for the most pogo stick jumps by Bobbys Greyfriar in Edinburgh. &#8211; <a href="http://www.ashrita.com/stories/honoring_bobby">Honouring Bobby Greyfriar</a> at Ashrita.com</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/colliseum.jpg" class="float-left" alt="Ashrita collaseum" />On a recent visit to Europe, Ashrita succeeded in breaking two Guinness World Records, despite gaining 7 pounds, (courtesy of Italian ice cream.)</p>
<p>Ashrita&#8217;s first record was for the most jumps on a pogo stick in one minute. Ashrita  managed to break the record, completing 256 valid jumps in one minute, adding an extra 12 jumps to the previous record of 234. (This works out at over 4 jumps per second). The record was set to the backdrop of the famous coliseum in Rome.</p>
<p>Ashrita&#8217;s second successful attempt was in Munich, at the Impossibility Challenger event. This involved running a sub eight minute mile on stilts.</p>
<p>The Impossibility Challenger event  is held annually in Munich and involves a diverse range of feats of self transcendence. Previous challenges have involved, the longest continual laughing, playing music for 24 hours non stop, and riding a bicycle the wrong way. Often the event attracts quite a few Guinness World Record attempts.</p>
<p>For an entertaining read of Ashrita&#8217;s battle against impossibility, Italian Gelato and pastries see his own blog entry &#8211; <a href="http://www.ashrita.com/blog/archive/2008/04/30/worth-the-weight">Worth the Weight </a></p>
