<p>Pranava Gigja, active for the Peace and Harmony Run in Iceland since the beginning, opened the new store supplying a variety of dietary supplements and healthy foods, such as organic chocolate, the Madal Bal syrup for the lemon diet and various organic teas. The place is called &#8220;Mother Knows Best &#8211; Pure Health&#8221; and is open five days a week. In the future, Pranava hopes to include a raw food and salad corner and is actively distributing his products all over Iceland and in other North European countries. One key product is his Magnesium powder, one of the major supplements for a healthy diet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Zurich, members of the Sri Chinmoy Centre have recently founded a new ice-cream bar/ cafe in the centre of Zurich.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2069" alt="Vegelateria" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Vegelateria.jpg" width="500" height="471" /></p>
<p>The Divine Enterprise was inaugurated in January 2013, in the centre  of Zurich. The name of the enterprise is  &#8220;The Sacred and Secret Way of Amazing Strength&#8221; which had  been given by Sri Chinmoy himself some 12 years ago. Abarita Dänzer,  owner of the &#8220;Secrets of Perfection-Flames&#8221; (Tofu Factory) took over a  former vegan bakery and take-away, and transformed it into a Vegelateria. A unique new ice-cream parlour,  where you can get more than 20 different ice creams, all vegan and  without conventional sugar. The local newspapers as well as the vegan  community are happy about the new place which for the moment holds only  10 seats in additional to the Take-Away. From Monday through Saturday  Pradatta Schrottenholzer and his helpers also offer hot meals, a daily  soup, salads and drinks. Abaraita plans to enlarge to 25 and later to 75  seats as soon as the needed requirements from the Health Authorities  are fulfilled. Also planned are regular monthly exhibitions and events  covering subjects such as health, nutrition, meditation, consciousness  and awareness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &#8216;Run and Become&#8217; chain of running stores was started in the early 1980&#8217;s in London by one of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s students Ongkar Tony Smith. The name comes from one of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s aphorisms: <em>‘Run and Become, Become and Run. Run to succeed in the outer world. Become to proceed in the inner world.</em>’ There are now two other shops, in Edinburgh and Cardiff.</p>

<p>After 20 years in business, the Edinburgh store has just moved to a new City Centre location in Queensferry Street. This follows on from a major renovation of the London store 18 months ago.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2012-04-01-at-22.56.33.png"><img class="wp-image-1469 aligncenter" title="Screen shot 2012-04-01 at 22.56.33" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2012-04-01-at-22.56.33.png" alt="" width="465" height="309" /></a></p>
<p>To mark the opening, there was a small ceremony attended by many Scottish athletics luminaries.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s students will come together to open up an enterprise or business such as a shop or cafe &#8211; this means they can create a tranquil meditative atmosphere in which to work, and also for the public it means a peaceful oasis where they can come and unwind.</p>
<p>In an article just published on the Sri Chinmoy Centre site, cafe owner Toshala Elliot describes one such enterprise &#8211; the Blue Bird cafe in Auckland, New Zealand, which has now been running for over 13 years. &#8216;The Blue Bird&#8217; is actually a name that Sri Chinmoy suggested for the cafe. Sri Chinmoy, in his artwork, has frequently used the bird as a metaphor for the unhorizoned flight of the soul; similarly blue, the colour of the sea and the sky also evokes that feeling of meditative vastness.</p>
