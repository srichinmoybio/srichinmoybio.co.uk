<p>Sri Chinmoy hoped the Peace Run, would help spread the ideals of peace and harmony throughout the world. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This world of ours has everything except one thing: peace. Everybody wants and needs peace, whether he be a child or an octogenarian.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy [1]</p>
<blockquote><p>World-peace<br />
Can be achieved<br />
When the power of love<br />
Replaces<br />
The love of power.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy [2]</p>

<p>The World Harmony Run seeks to unite people in a celebration of what we all have in common. The closing ceremony took place amidst a vibrant display in the main square by many community groups including dance, martial arts, and cultural groups. One of the most interesting displays was a giant rocking horse, where to make it rock you have to work in unison.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 12, runners and supporters of the World Harmony Run from around the globe gathered at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza for the Opening Ceremony of the U.S. World Harmony Run.<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/0412_50.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1485 aligncenter" title="0412_50" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/0412_50.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>The event was attended by many dignitaries and ambassadors from around the world. It also offered an opportunity for the Run to honour individuals and groups who have worked tirelessly for peace in their own way. For example, the World Harmony Run Torch Bearer award was given to the people of Japan for thir stoicism, courage, cheerfulness in coping with the ordeal of the earthquake and tsunami last year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/0412_34.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1484 aligncenter" title="0412_34" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/0412_34.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>The runners will now embark on a journey across all 48 continental states (with local events in Alaska and Hawaii) which will end in August.</p>

<p>In Cambridge, the run visited Kings College Cambridge and was met by Dr John Barber, a Fellow of King&#8217;s College.</p>

<p>The run was also greeted by the Mayor of Cambridge who supported the Run&#8217;s hope to promote peace and harmony.</p>
<p>In Oxford, the run visited two schools and also found time to visit Mark Williams and his team of researchers at Warneford hospital. Mark Williams heads a &#8216;mindfulness clinic&#8217; which has researched the benefits of meditation in helping to cure persistent depression. The successful research has led to mindfulness being prescribed as a treatment on the National Health Service.</p>

<p>Mike Williams was awarded a &#8216;Harmony Torch bearer award&#8217; for his contribution in empowering people to overcome depression.</p>
<p>In Oxford, there was also a visit to Harcourt Arboretum, where a Peace Tree was planted to leave a lasting legacy for peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/peace-tree.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1462" title="peace-tree" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/peace-tree.jpg" alt="peace-tree" width="450" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;The flower of the life-tree is wisdom.<br />
The fruit of the life-tree is peace.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Harmony Run was  founded by Indian Peace-Philosopher, Sri Chinmoy, 25 years ago; recently the run returned to its roots visiting cities in south India. The run which seeks to promote peace, friendship and harmony was joined by many Indians in Delhi and Agra.</p>

<p>Sri Chinmoy was born in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) in 1931 and he moved to New York, US in 1964. On the spirituality of India, Sri Chinmoy wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;India&#8217;s strength is not in her arms, but in her heart. More so, it is in her seer-vision.</p>
<p>India tells the world that the realisation of unity is the only strength which can conquer the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;India has three world-conquering weapons: Non-violence, Peace and the Wisdom which tells that she is in All as All is in her.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1365-1' id='fnref-1365-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1365)'>1</a></sup></p>
