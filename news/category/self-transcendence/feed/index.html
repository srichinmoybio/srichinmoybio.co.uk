				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 27th of July, Adriano Passini completed the 43rd successful English Channel crossing by a member of the Sri Chinmoy Marathon in a time of 11 hours 10 minutes. It was the first successful crossing by a Brazilian member of the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2218" alt="channel-swim" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/chrisosmond-adriano-karteek-after-swim-500x375.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Adriano began his swim in the very early hours of the morning at 02:37. Conditions proved to be a mixture of warm sea temperatures, rain, mist, and thunderstorms. Adriano had to also contend with jellyfish and large sea vessels. However, as he approached the French coast, 11 hours later, weather conditions became favourable. Adriano was supported by a dedicated boat and his two main helpers Ashirvad Zaiantchick and Karteek Clarke (a veteran of 10 channel crossings himself) &#8211; his helpers proudly mentioned that Adriano never complained, but cheerfully stuck to the task in hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_2219" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-2219" alt="adrianochannelswimmingboat" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/adrianochannelswimmingboat.jpg" width="500" height="375" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Adriano swimming the channel</p></div>
<p>Adriano has been dreaming of achieving this swim for the past couple of years. Recently, he has competed a few long swims in preparation; this included the Zurich Lake Self-Transcendence Marathon Swim, a 26km race organized by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy encouraged his students to swim the channel, saying it offered a great challenge for individual self-transcendence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The English Channel frightens the human body. The English Channel challenges the human vital. The English Channel puzzles the human mind. The English Channel invites the human heart. The English Channel treasures the human soul. &#8221; [1]</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy <span id="more-2217"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;When we are inspired, we try to swim the English Channel. When we are inspired, we go from one country to another country to inspire people and to be inspired by them. I feel that when we inspire humanity, we automatically become good citizens of the world. This is my philosophy.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>

<p>It is the latest in a string of marathon victories, having won in Edinburgh and Toulouse within the past year. Over 17,000 people took part in the Belfast marathon this year.</p>
<p>Samunnati is a frequent participant in the World Harmony Run, a torch relay event that travels the globe carrying a message of international friendship and understanding. She has been part of the international team for many European runs and in 2008 she joined the team in Australia as it circumnavigated the entire continent. The below photograph shows her carrying the Torch during a 2012 run in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>In addition to the many runners, there is a whole team of helpers, counters, cooks, medical staff and volunteers who help to manage the running of the race. The race is documented by photographers, writers and videographers, including:</p>
<h4>Perfection Journey &#8211; Utpal&#8217;s blog</h4>
<blockquote><p><em>It is Monday afternoon and the one mile loop of the Self Transcendence races is alive with movement. Some like Alex Swenson are running with such strength and poise that I have to remind myself that he has been here now for more than 24 hours and has already completed 116 miles in that time. <a href="http://perfectionjourney.org/2013/04/23/april-22-dance-of-life/">Continue reading</a>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://perfectionjourney.org/category/6-10-day-race-2013/">6 and 10 day race</a> at Perfection Journey</p>
<h4>Arpan&#8217;s Race blogs</h4>
<blockquote><p><em>On Tuesday night, around midnight, the Ten Day runners have completed six and a half days. So they are over halfway done with only three and a half days to go to the finish line. The Six Day runners have completed two and a half days and are closing in on their halfway point in 12 hours. They also only have three and a half days as runners of both races have the same finishing time, Saturday, April 27 at 12:00 Noon.</em></p>
<p><em>Now that all of the runners have experienced the ‘thrill’ of staying on their feet and moving forward at various speeds most of the day and night, day after day and night after night, they all have their own interpretations of what this unusual experience is like to them.</em></p>
<p><em>I am particularly interested in the experiences expressed by the first-timers who have never had this kind of experience before. Nirbhasa Magee, a computer programmer from Dublin, Ireland, has run marathons for many years and even completed a 24-Hour race recently. But this is his first time at a multiday race. He is running the Ten Day race and had completed five and a half days already when I asked him what the high points and low points of the race was to him so far. He had completed 295 miles by the halfway point, which was noon on Monday. This is an average of almost 60 miles per day so far which is quite good for a first time multiday runner.</em>.</p>

<p>Samunnati hails from Ukraine and is the fastest female runner in the international Sri Chinmoy Centres. Earlier this year she won the marathon in Edinburgh, Scotland. When running she tries to invoke spiritual energy to help her in the race. Samunnati says she is inspired by Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s deep love of running.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sri Chinmoy Cycling Challenge is an opportunity for people to get involved in a global cycling challenge and log their efforts to target a specific cycle distance. In July/August 2012 members of the Sri Chinmoy Centre in Europe organized four cycling events to inspire people to cycle more. The first event was the 27-Hour Cycling Relay on 21/22 July in Serbia, organized by Nikhad. Cycling started at 7:00 on Saturday and went on over the night and until 10:00 am next day. There were 13 participants, nine of them were cycling in Nish, two in Belgrade and two in Leskovac. Total distance covered was 1246 km and the longest distance was done by Nikhad Pavlovic with 288km.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1788" title="cycling" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/27hZH2008_group_web.jpg" alt="cycling" width="500" height="259" /></p>

<p>The next event, a 12-Hour Cycling Relay, happened on August 5, 2012, in Sofia, Bulgaria, and was organized by Hrishikesh. Four participants totalled 366 km. The most successful participant was Radko Popinski who cycled 140km. On the same day there was another cycling event, The Self-Transcendence Triathlon on Divljan lake in Serbia, organized by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team Nish. Besides Serbian sportsmen, the event attracted quite a few participants from Bulgaria. A total of 19 athletes competed in two disciplines: the Olympian (1.5km/40km/10km) and sprint triathlon (0.7km/20km/5km). The winner in the Olympic category was Igor Jovanovic from Nish, Serbia; in the sprint category the winner was Branimir Djuricic from Jagodina, Serbia.</p>
<p>The fourth event was the 27-Hour Cycling Relay on 11/12 August, 2012. The main cycling took place in Zurich, Switzerland, from 7:00 am on 11th August until 10:00 am on 12th August. During the same 27 hours cyclists joined in Geneva, Basel, Winterthur, Baden, as well as in Subotica, Serbia. 42 participants achieved all together 1986.5 km, with the longest distance being absolved by Nikhad Pavlovic</p>
<p>(263.98km).</p>
<p>And finally a Cycling Week in October 2012 was dedicated to the 5th anniversary of Sri Chinmoy’s mahasamadhi. Cyclists could join any day and anywhere starting on October 5th and finishing at midnight, October 11th. Thirty-five cycling-lovers took part in seven different countries: Switzerland, Italy, USA, Germany, Bosnia &amp; Hercegovina, Serbia and Bulgaria with a total distance of 1515 km.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the beginning of July the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team in Bristol, UK, organized their first triathlon. The event was targeted to beginning triathletes, combining a 246 meter swim (or 8 lengths of an outdoor pool), a 17K bike ride and a 3K run. One hundred aspiring triathletes competed, which was the maximum number of participants allowed. Despite the rainy weather the event was a great success and will become a yearly feature.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;I have the deepest admiration for those who participate in triathlons. Swimming reminds us of our spiritual life. Right now we are swimming in the sea of ignorance, but we are praying to our Beloved Supreme and meditating on Him to be able to swim in the sea of Light and Delight. When we are running, we are reminded of our birthless and deathless journey along Eternity&#8217;s Road. Then, while we are cycling, we are reminding ourselves of evolution, of how the world is evolving in cycles&#8221; (</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samunnati Nataliya Lehonkova from the Sri Chinmoy Centre in Ternopilska, Ukraine, has won the Edinburgh marathon last Sunday May 27th. Under warm conditions and on a hilly marathon course Samunnati completed the race in 2:39:46. It was her second marathon win in her running career, after a win in Poland in 2010. Also it was her second marathon in 6 weeks, after she had placed second in the marathon of Utrecht (The Netherlands) last April in a personal best of 2:39:20. She commented that now she will take some well-deserved rest.</p>
<div id="attachment_1628" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/self-transcendence/samunnati-wins-the-edinburgh-marathon/attachment/samunnati1/" rel="attachment wp-att-1628"><img class="size-large wp-image-1628" title="Samunnati's finish" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Samunnati1-500x333.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Samunnati breaks the tape in the Edinburgh marathon</p></div>
<p>Samunnati says that Sri Chinmoy inspires her in her running career. His philosophy of self-transcendence and going beyond one&#8217;s own preconceived limitations is a source of constant satisfaction to her. Sri Chinmoy encouraged his students to stay physically fit by running. Samunnati feels that the spiritual energy she receives from her daily meditation helps her in her running life. As Sri Chinmoy writes, &#8220;Through prayer and meditation we can develop intense will-power, and this will-power can help us do extremely well in our outer running.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the race members of the Sri Chinmoy Centre in Edinburg cheered her on. In the evening they celebrated her victory at their Sunday night meditation.</p>
