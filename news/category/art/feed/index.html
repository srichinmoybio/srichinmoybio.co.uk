<p>The exhibition held at 54 Elgin at Queen includes a selection of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s unique artistic creations, which have been widely admired for their vividness, spontaneity and spiritual feeling. The exhibition will be held until April.</p>

<blockquote><p>“When it is a matter of my paintings, there is no mind, no form. Something within me is coming to the fore freely, effortlessly, with infinite inspiration…spreading its beauty and light so that my paintings flow spontaneously. When I paint, I try to go deep within to the source of creativity where it is all peace, calmness and quiet.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>A painting of Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>&#8220;Jharna-Kala&#8221; is the Bengali name Sri Chinmoy chose for his artwork. The English translation is &#8220;Fountain Art&#8221; &#8211; which signifies art flowing from the source of creation, flowing from the inspiration he receives in meditation.</p>
<p>He began painting on November 19th, 1974 in Ottawa, Canada. Over the next 33 years, Sri Chinmoy produced a prolific output of paintings.</p>
<p>One art critic commented on the paintings of Sri Chinmoy:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Instead of seeing the world as a concrete, solid body where things are separate, Sri Chinmoy sees the world as a unity where all things seem to move together. The paintings are physical manifestations of his inner meditations. They show a higher level of consciousness.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; T.J.Bergen, Secretary American Contemporary Artists Galleries.</p>

In 1991, during a visit to the island of Malta, <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/biography.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> began a new phase in his artistic career, by drawing the first of what he called &#8216;Dream-Freedom Peace birds&#8217;. The birds are often popularly known as &#8216;soul-birds&#8217; by virtue of the fact that they represent the boundless flight of the human soul. &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic">For me, birds have a very special significance on a spiritual level.</span>&#8220;, says Sri Chinmoy. &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic">They fly in the sky, and the sky is all freedom. So when the birds fly in the sky, they remind me of the soul&#8217;s infinite freedom. The soul has come from Heaven. When we think of birds, we are also reminded of our Source, and this gives us enormous joy</span>. &#8221;</p>
<p>To date, Sri Chinmoy has drawn over 15 million of these birds, either in single drawings or in vast artworks that contain hundreds of different birds. As well as his other &#8216;Jharna-Kala&#8217; paintings, his bird drawings have been exhibited in many prestigious locations around the world such as the Louvre and the Sydney Opera House. There have been several exhibitions with large numbers of soul-birds, including an exhibition of one million birds in Ottawa in 1994 and another exhibition of 200,000 birds  in Augsburg.</p>

Over the years, Sri Chinmoy has used a great deal of imagination in his chice of artistic &#8216;canvas&#8217; &#8211; as well as a wide variety of paper, he has painted birds on sheets of fabric supended from a line, and also used a wide variety of everyday objects to draw birds on &#8211; plates, cups, seashells, even clocks and children&#8217;s toys! He will often do a series of drawings using one particular medium &#8211; for example, in late 2004 whilst visiting China, Sri Chinmoy drew a series of birds on Chinese rice paper using traditional calligraphy brushes, whilst in November 2006, he drew another series of birds on black paper which when scratched reveals the coloured paper underneath.</p>
<p>Drawing these birds is something that always gives Sri Chinmoy great joy. <span class="pgraphdefault">&#8220;<span style="font-style: italic">When I draw a bird, I think of the soul — new creation, new hope, new promise, new peace, new bliss and new perfection on earth</span>&#8220;, he says. He will often use what other people would consider &#8216;dead time&#8217; &#8211; time waiting for something to happen or travelling between places &#8211; do draw a few more of these beautiful birds, exemplifying his philosophy of never wasting a moment. Such is the speed at which he draws these creations that one feels the artist is not so much creating something as setting something free that was already there.</span> For many people, viewing Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s birds evoke a spontaneous sense of thir own inner flight, and they have met with much praise and admiration over the years from art critics all around the world.</p>

In 1974, Sri Chinmoy took up painting as yet another field through which he could inspire his fellow man. He called his painting &#8216;Jharna-Kala&#8217; meaning fountain-art&#8217; in his native Bengali, or art flowing from the inner source. Sri Chinmoy says of his painting:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.srichinmoycentre.org/gallery/d/257237-2/P1020180ab.jpg" style="float: right" /><br />
<span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;The whole picture does not come to me at once. As I start painting, I see a streak of light right ahead of me and devotedly I try to follow that streak of light. But on some rare occasions the light is so powerful that I envision the painting long before I have actually touched the paper, I don’t bring it forth; it comes to the fore from within. In the light the colour is there. Each time I see the streak of light, I see the colour.”</span></p>
<p>In the years following his entry into the art world, Sri Chinmoy produced an enormous number of paintings &#8211; almost 200,000 in the year 1975 alone. In 1991 he began a new series of drawings titles &#8216;Soul-Birds&#8217; &#8211; drawings of birds that capture aspects of the human soul. To date he has drawn over 15 million of these birds.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s paintings have been displayed in such notable galleries as the Louvre; in addition, exhibitions have been held in national houses of parliament and UN-affiliated organisations across the world. At the time of writing, there are travelling exhibitions of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s artwork in quite a few countries all across the world: last year saw exhibitions in London and Paris, and a recent exhibition was held in the Ukraine early this year.</p>
