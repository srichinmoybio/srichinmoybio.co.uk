				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Chinmoy saw the New Year as an opportunity to make great progress and would often give specific New Year Messages for the coming year. This extract expresses some of his philosophy about the potential of the New Year.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1950 aligncenter" alt="new-year" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/sunrise-sky-yorks.jpg" width="400" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;On the eve of the New Year, a new consciousness dawns on earth. God once again inspires each human being, each creature, with new hope, new light, new peace and new joy. God says, &#8220;The New Year dawns and a new consciousness dawns within you. Run toward the destined Goal.&#8221; We listen to God, to the dictates of our Inner Pilot, and we run toward the ultimate Reality. The New Year energises us, encourages us and inspires us to run toward that ultimate Goal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When the New Year dawns, we have to make ourselves conscious of the fact that we have to transcend ourselves this year. We have to go beyond our present capacity, beyond our present achievement. When we have that kind of firm determination, God showers His choicest Blessings upon us.&#8221;</p>

</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to begin to learn how to meditate is  to associate with poeple who have been meditating for some time. These  people are not in a position to teach you, but they are in a position to  inspire you. If you have some friends who know how to meditate, just  sit beside them while they are meditating. Unconsciously your inner  being will be able to derive some meditative power from them. You are  not stealing anything from them, but your inner being is taking help  from them without your outer knowledge&#8230;..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 100%"> Do not go gentle into that good night,<br />
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right">- Dylan Thomas</p>
<p>As you get older, it can be very easy to fall into the trap of feeling you have to take it easy and wind down the activities you were once doing. However, there are many people who feel they have to squeeze every drop out of life right till the end &#8211; for example Ed Whitlock, the Canadian who ran a sub-3 hour marathon at the age of 73. Another example is Sri Chinmoy, who at the age of 75, is still making eye-opening contributions in the field of poetry, art and strength fitness to show the world that, regardless of age, each one of us can still pursue our dreams to be a better person and work for a better world. He feels that old age only becomes a problem when one lives in the hesitating mind rather the ever-new heart: &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic" class="pgraphanswer">The heart is always carrying newness, whereas the mind is carrying oldness.</span><span class="pgraphanswer">&#8220;, he says. &#8220;</span><span class="pgraphanswer"><span style="font-style: italic">For the mind, there is no newness. By the second day, the mind loses all its enthusiasm because it feels that everything is too old, too old, too old. But for the heart, every day is new, like the sun.</span>&#8221; [1]</span></p>
<p>He cites the example of the great cellist Pablo Casals<span class="pgraphdefault">, who still practised every day at 95 years old. Once someone asked him, &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic">Why do you practise at your age? You have become the greatest cellist. Now you can rest!</span>&#8221; Casals replied: </span><span class="pgraphdefault">&#8220;<span style="font-style: italic">You want me to rest? You do not want me to make any progress? Every day I am playing the cello and I have been playing for years and years, ever since my childhood. Every day I feel I have made some progress</span>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>This statement is very insightful, as it reveals some very important requirements to keeping (and even increasing) your productivity as you stay into old age:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be a child at heart.  &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic" class="pgraphanswer">If you can feel that you are not thirty or forty or fifty years old, but only seven years old, you will be able to discard so many of your bad qualities in the twinkling of an eye&#8230;</span><span class="pgraphanswer"><span style="font-style: italic">every day you will see your life in a new way and your sweet, sweeter, sweetest qualities you will be able to bring forward once again</span>.&#8221; [2] Children have that wonderful quality of not nursing grudges or disappointments and seeing newness in everything. Think about it; how many times as a child you played with your favourite toy or watch your favourite videos; whereas as an adult we get bored of everything after one or two uses. Regaining these childlike qualities will help us have new and beautiful experiences no matter what age we are.</span><span class="pgraphanswer"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="pgraphanswer">Keep up a sense of discipline. No matter what age we are, we still have to practise daily to reach our goals. With a doable learning curve and a well-thought out schedule, anything is possible. Again the difference in the mind&#8217;s and heart&#8217;s perspectives comes into play here: With the mind&#8217;s jaded viewpoint, it can be very easy to regard discipline as something painful and monotonous, but like Pablo</span><span class="pgraphanswer"> Casals you can instead view it as a chance for progress.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aim for progress rather than for success. Focusing on an external result (which might be beyond your control) can be frustrating if things don&#8217;t happen according to plan, whereas it is much easier to get joy from progress on a day-to-day basis. Success is often taken to mean a big result, whereas progress can lie in simple things like even persisting despite the odds.</li>
</ul>
