				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Sri Chinmoy Library, we have published some of the early volumes of AUM magazine. The first edition of AUM was published on 27th August 1965 &#8211; just over a year after Sri Chinmoy arrived in New York, US. The <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/periodicals/a">AUM magazines</a> contain a treasure of early talks, question and answers, poetry and discourses by Sri Chinmoy. The AUM magazines provided material for many of the first books published by Sri Chinmoy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next few months more editions of AUM magazine will be added to Sri Chinmoy Library.</p>
<p>The first talk in the AUM vol 1. No. 1. is on the subject of AUM</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;AUM is the soundless sound. It is the vibration of the Supreme. When one hears the soundless sound within, when one identifies oneself with it, when one lives within it, one can be freed from the fetters of ignorance and realise the Supreme within and without.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Manatita Hutchinson, a student of Sri Chinmoy for over 30 years, has recently written a book about Sri Chinmoy and being on Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s path. <span id="more-2300"></span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-2301 alignleft" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" alt="manatita" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/manatita.jpg" width="200" />The book <em>&#8216;My Guru, Sri Chinmoy: Life and Teachings&#8217; </em>offers Manatita&#8217;s personal perspective on the life and teachings of Sri Chinmoy. It includes some chapters on Manatita&#8217;s first steps into the spiritual life and how he came to adopt the lifestyle of a seeker. He also places into context what he feels are the most important teachings from Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s body of works.</p>
<p>For those wishing to gain an insight into the spiritual philosophy of Sri Chinmoy, this makes an excellent introduction. Pir Zia Inayat Khan, Head, Sufi Order International, writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Sri Chinmoy was a dear friend of my father, Pir Vilayat, and a kind presence in my own life. Manatita Hutchinson&#8217;s lucid account of his life and teachings is a valuable contribution to the Guru&#8217;s legacy, and will be welcomed by all who knew and esteemed him.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Manatita says he was inspired to write the book because he wished to share with sincere seekers how much his own life has been shaped and moulded by his Guru, Sri Chinmoy. Manatita says that he feels he has only been able to give a glimpse into the Master-disciple relationship and what Sri Chinmoy means, but he hopes that it will provide an objective introduction into the philosophy and life of Sri Chinmoy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr Pradhan Balter has published a new book title <b>&#8216;A Twenty-First Century Seeker&#8217; &#8211; maintaining spiritual principles in a very hectic world</b>. It aims to provide a simple and effective guide for seekers who wish to develop their meditation and follow a spiritual life.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2152" style="margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px;" alt="pradhan-twenty-first-century" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/image-seeker-book.jpg" width="300" />Pradhan has been giving meditation classes for over 40 years. This book seeks to convey the most important principles and useful tips that he has learned from being a student of Sri Chinmoy and reflects his own experience of giving classes. The book stands as a practical manual and reference point for those seeking to discovery more about their inner self. The book, divided into different chapters, contains advice, exercises, and quotes from spiritual Teachers. Pradhan also suggests that seekers create an “inner mission statement” and commit to lifestyle that allows the seeker to fulfill that mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently spoke to Pradhan about how he came to write the book. He says about 17 years ago, someone who was very inspired by his classes transcribed word-for-word 4 days of classes. She then handed the transcription over to Pradhan saying, “Here! You have to write a book.” Moved by the dedication it required to do the transcription, Pradhan asked his spiritual Teacher if it was a good idea. Sri Chinmoy responded with an enthusiastic “Do it! Do it!” Upon reviewing the transcription, Pradhan noted that the spoken word doesn&#8217;t always transcribe so well. He explained, “In a class, I could change the meaning of what I was saying with a gesture or change in intonation. You don’t have that luxury with the written word. You have to be much more precise.” So Pradhan spent 17 years refining and adding to the book. The following are extracts from an interview with Pradhan.</p>
<p><span id="more-2151"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Qu: What was the aim of the book.</em></p>
<p>Pradhan: The book is a culmination of different talks I have offered to seekers on different aspects of the spiritual life as I have understood them from my spiritual Teacher Sri Chinmoy. I wanted to present these in an organized and accessible way. It can serve as a step-by-step guidebook for a seeker who wants to learn and understand meditation, but can also serve a guide for someone who wants to offer meditation classes themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Qu. What is the most important thing for a beginner to meditation?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pradhan: The key to meditation is appropriate aspiration. This is our hunger for something higher. And so I begin by simply asking the reader to consider what really gives their life meaning. If they could “paint themselves perfectly”, how would they choose to be? I have asked this question to literally thousands of seekers and it is quite revealing that the answers are always this incredible list of inner qualities: being more peaceful, self-giving, forgiving, loving, etc. Believe it or not, only once or twice has someone answered “outer success”. This question and the collective answers forms the framework for the remainder of the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Qu. What makes a good class giver?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pradhan: When teaching meditation, there are 2 aspects to a class: an outer aspect, that is, the content but an even more important inner aspect. For example, someone can give a very polished class, well organized, thought out but if there is no inner conviction then the class has no inner authority. On the other hand, a class can be all devotion but somewhat devoid of outer content. I think this has merit as well because students will feel the devotion of the teacher. If you have both, then that is the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a teacher, I think its very important to practice what is called “empathic listening.” When a question is asked, really listen. This is something I had to learn as well. Most people formulate an answer to a question even before the question is fully asked! Better to wait, give full attention to the asker, and let the question percolate a little inwardly before offering an answer!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Qu. What have you learned from giving meditation classes?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pradhan: Giving classes has played a major role in my spiritual life. Being constantly placed in front of new and fresh aspiration is such a benefit. When you give a class, you are compelled to be in a good consciousness because you are speaking on behalf of the soul/aspiration of the seeker. For me, the moment I step in front of a group, I feel the necessity of representing Guru (Sri Chinmoy), and it compels me to be in a better consciousness. I ALWAYS have wonderful meditations in classes, and this is an experience that many other teachers have had as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Qu. What was the experience of writing the book?</em></p>
<p>Pradhan: It helped to solidify my own inner experience. Like a spiritual diary, writing can renew your own inner experiences. Even if you don’t plan to teach a class, I encourage everyone to write down their spiritual experiences. You can then always go back to it for inspiration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Qu. In the past 42 years what were some of your most memorable moments in the spiritual life, apart from giving meditation classes?</em></p>
<p>Pradhan: With my own Teacher Sri Chinmoy, I received the most wonderful blessings on every end of the spiritual life spectrum. On the one hand, I can always invoke the feeling of sitting with Guru, and he would just place his foot on my lap. As I sit here recollecting that, I get inwardly choked up. How did I get that role? On the other end of the spectrum, this outer closeness also came with a special kind of blessing: Guru’s scoldings! I was fortunate to have a close outer relationship with Guru. Scolding compelled me to look within, deeper, longer and more profoundly than anything else. Nothing compelled me to change more than one of these special blessings.</p>
<p>Guru was living embodiment of his teachings and transcendence was the corner-stone of these teachings. Guru was a driving force and always encouraging us out of our comfort zones into something bigger, requiring greater capacity. Guru would push you into transcendence. Complacency wasn&#8217;t acceptable. (In Pradhan’s other book,- &#8216;<a href="http://www.atthefeetofmymaster.com">At The Feet of My Master</a>&#8216;  there is an entire chapter dedicated to his scoldings. Sri Chinmoy affectionately told Pradhan that this was his favorite chapter!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a new book was published entitled &#8211; <strong>Sport and Meditation</strong>  &#8211; <em>the inner dimension of sport</em> by Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1767" style="margin-left: 9px; margin-right: 9px;" title="sport-meditation" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/sport-meditation-228x300.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="300" /></p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy taught that sport and meditation can easily complement each other. For example, Sri Chinmoy wrote that the poise we gain from meditation can increase our outer strength.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;In sports we need energy, strength and dynamism. When we meditate, we make our mind calm and quiet. If inside us there is peace, then we will derive tremendous strength from our inner life. That is to say, if I have a peaceful moment, even for one second, that peace will come to me as solid strength in my sports, whether I am running or jumping or throwing. That strength is almost indomitable strength, whereas if we are restless, we do not have strength like that.</em>&#8221; [1]</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy himself was an active sportsman. In his early life, he was the decathlon champion of the ashram where he grew up. Later in life, he took up weightlifting &#8211; demonstrating that the power of meditation can help us to transcend our capacities.</p>
<p>The new compilation of writings by Sri Chinmoy includes a foreward by 3-time duathlon World Champion, Olivier Bernhard. He begins</p>
<p><em>&#8220;For me, sport is meditation. Athletes in many sports speak about experiencing a state of energy flow when being in perfect balance with their mind and body. It is a state where pain and fatigue do not exist.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The book is published by Goldenshore.de. It contains inspiring anecdotes with great athletes such as Carl Lewis (a long time friend of Sri Chinmoy) It also includes practical tips how you can improve your own sporting practise through incorporating techniques of concentration and meditation. There is also a section on self-transcendence for older people. With his weightlifting, Sri Chinmoy wished to show that age need not be a barrier.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;There is no age limit. When we pray and meditate, we go far beyond the domain of the mind, the physical mind that doubts our capacities.&#8221; (p.174, Sport and Meditation)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Auspicious Good Fortune&#8217; is a new book by Sumangali Morhall, which tells of her journey from disillusionment to interest in meditation and becoming a student of Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p>Published by Mantra Books, it is available at Amazon and selected independent book stores. The book gives a first hand account of life as a student of Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/auspicious-good-fortune.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1509" style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px;" title="auspicious-good-fortune" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/auspicious-good-fortune-193x300.jpg" alt="" width="175" /></a>Sumangali writes on the experience of writing the book:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I began writing down a few memories several years ago, and after Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s passing in 2007, wondered about joining them together in a book. This was partly in the hope of telling the story to others who may find it interesting or inspiring, and partly for my own sake so I<br />
did not forget my experiences.</p>
<p>It has taken three years to write in earnest and to find a publisher, so today is the culmination of a long but rewarding journey. This has been a significant part of my own sadhana during this time: a spiritual discipline, and a creative outlet. Overall it has been a way to offer my gratitude to Sri Chinmoy for the countless ways he has led me to a happier and more conscious life&#8230;&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new collection of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s writings <em>called The Jewels of Happiness </em>is to be published &#8211; the book touches on themes such as inspired living, inner peace and creating inner joy.</p>
<p>The Jewels of Happiness is published by Watkins and includes a collection of poems, aphorisms and writings with wisdom for living a more peaceful and joyful life.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/jewels-happiness.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-842" title="jewels-happiness" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/jewels-happiness.jpg" alt="jewels happiness" width="300" height="300" /></a>&#8220;Try not to change the world. You will fail. Try to love the world. Lo, the world is changed. Changed forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy (1)</p>
<p>&#8220;Joy, spontaneity and self-giving always go together. If one has a  joyful heart, that means that one possesses spontaneity or a spontaneous  heart and also that one is self-giving. Or we can say that self-giving  is the hyphen, the connecting link, between joy and spontaneity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy, The Jewels of Happiness</p>
<p>The Jewels of Happiness will be on sale from September 7th. In the forward to the book, Archbishop Desmond Tutu writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>“These sweet gems of wisdom by my dear friend Sri Chinmoy are timeless truths full of encouragement, love and goodness.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Smile, my friends, my soulful friends, smile. Let us smile. True, this world of ours is full of suffering and excruciating pangs, but that is no reason why we should not smile. We must smile in order to unburden the world&#8217;s suffering-burden. We must smile in order to diminish its untold pangs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Emil Zatopek was a great runner who achieved the unique feat of winning three gold medals at the  1952 Helsinki Olympics (5Km, 10Km and marathon). He had great determination and moral character. Sri Chinmoy admired the feats of Emil Zatopek and wrote a book in his honour.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/books/0408">Emil Zatopek: Earth&#8217;s Tearing Cry And Heaven&#8217;s Beaming Smile</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the case of Zatopek, higher reality and higher divinity descended on him precisely because he had confidence in his own capacities and also an implicit faith in the vision and satisfaction of the higher worlds. On the strength of his unparalleled confidence in himself and confidence in God, he not only conquered the runners&#8217; world but also illumined the consciousness of the runners&#8217; world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>
