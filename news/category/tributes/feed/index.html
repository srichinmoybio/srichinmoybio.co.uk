				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nelson Mandela, one of the world&#8217;s most admired leaders, recently passed away aged 95; Mandela personified South Africa&#8217;s transition to democracy and was greatly admired for his generosity of spirit and moral courage. Nelson Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 (jointly with F W De Klerk) Throughout his 95 years, Mandela sacrificed his life for the ideals of justice and peace and gave inspiration to millions across the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.”</p>
<p>— Nelson Mandela</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy met Nelson Mandela on a number of occasions, and said Nelson Mandela was one of the persons&#8217; he admired most <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sri-chinmoy-answers-11/interviewer-sri-chinmoy-who-are-the-living">[1]</a>. Sri Chinmoy wrote a book on Nelson Mandela entitled &#8216;<i>Nelson Mandela: The Pinnacle-Pillar of Mother Earth</i>&#8216; The book is a tribute to the ideals and vision of Nelson Mandela.</p>

<p>Sri Chinmoy also awarded Nelson Mandela the <a href="http://www.srichinmoy.org/service/u_thant_peace_award">U Thant Peace Award</a> in 1996, for Mandela&#8217;s commitment to the ideals of peace, forgiveness and harmony.</p>

<p><strong>Some selected quotes by Sri Chinmoy on Nelson Mandela:</strong><b><br />
</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Nelson Mandela:<br />
The pinnacle-pillar<br />
Of Mother Earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherever he goes,<br />
He carries with him<br />
The tears and smiles<br />
Of sweetness-love.</p>
<p> <span id="more-2304"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Whoever genuinely desires<br />
To redress humanity’s suffering<br />
Feels behind him one hundred per cent<br />
The living presence of Mandela’s heart.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">President Mandela’s very name<br />
Builds a hope-cathedral<br />
In the heart of despair-flooded humanity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In Mandela they found<br />
The inspiration-fountain<br />
Of their lives<br />
And the aspiration-mountain<br />
Of their hearts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He is a magician supreme!<br />
He transforms<br />
Our very long-standing bitterness<br />
Into our abiding sweetness<br />
In the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He tells the sea-deep sorrow-sufferers:<br />
‘My brothers and my sisters.<br />
Here and now smile with a new start<br />
Tomorrow’s Golden Dawn is come!’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The citizens of the whole world<br />
See in the circle<br />
Of President Mandela’s<br />
Fond embrace<br />
The blossoming joy of world-peace-hope<br />
And<br />
The fulfilling power of world-oneness-promise.</p>
<p><strong>Sri Chinmoy also set to music some of President Mandela&#8217;s immortal utterances.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;You must vow to turn misfortunes into victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Words of President Nelson Mandela</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Any man that tries to rob me of my dignity will lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Words of President Nelson Mandela</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong> Lifting up the world with a oneness heart</strong></p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy met with President Nelson Mandela at the Presidential Residence, South Africa. and honored him with the &#8220;Lifting Up The World With A Oneness-Heart&#8221; Award.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is President Nelson Mandela&#8217;s 95th birthday, and the Sri Chinmoy Centre would like to add its best wishes to the millions of birthday greetings from all around the world. Sri Chinmoy was a great admirer-friend of President Mandela, and the two had several warm and significant meetings.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2211" alt="nelson_mandela" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/nelson_mandela.jpg" width="370" height="235" /></p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy wrote a book called <em>Nelson Mandela: The Pinnacle-Pillar of Mother Earth</em> in his honour &#8211; below are some of the poems from the book:</p>
<p>“He tells poorer than the poorest human beings<br />
In every possible way:<br />
&#8216;Let us dream together.<br />
The Golden Dawn<br />
Will soon burst forth!&#8217;”</p>
<p>“President Mandela&#8217;s very name<br />
Builds a hope-cathedral<br />
In the heart of despair-flooded humanity.”</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I cannot express in words my joy! What you are doing is in the interest of the entire humanity and the world</em>.&#8221; &#8211; Nelson Mandela to Sri Chinmoy, meeting in South Africa, 1996</p>
<p>The above photo shows Sri Chinmoy and Nelson Mandela and his wife, Mama Graca holding the torch of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run, which Sri Chinmoy founded in 1987. While holding the torch President Mandela said: &#8220;We are with you in upholding peace, which brings solace to many people throughout the world. It doesn&#8217;t matter what language they speak. I think peace is one of the things that is going to save the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement released on his birthday, President Mandela&#8217;s health is reported to be steadily improving.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A statue of Sri Chinmoy offering a peace torch has been inaugurated in front of the National Parliament of Timor-Leste (East Timor), in a ceremony attended by dignitaries from all sections of Timorese society, including the President and the current and former Prime Ministers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="IMG_1882" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1882.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></p>
<p>There were many speakers at the ceremony. A representative of Bishop of Dili opened the proceedings. The World Harmony Run Torch-Bearer Award was presented to the current Prime Minister, H.E. Xanana Gusmão, and Timor-Leste&#8217;s first Prime Minister, H.E. Mari Alkatiri.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="IMG_1346" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1346.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></p>
<p>There was a very nice moment where Mr Gusmão, ran from the entrance the entrance with the Torch, and passed it to Dr Alkatiri, who in turn ran up the steps of the parliament and gave it to the President, H.E. Taur Matan Ruak.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="IMG_2556" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2556.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></p>
<p>A choir of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s students sang a song Sri Chinmoy had written in honour of East Timor, and also his song and &#8216;A New World of Peace&#8217;. The President then cut the ribbon to inaugurate the statue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img class="wp-image-2015 aligncenter" alt="IMG_1455" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1455-e1360661702228.jpg" width="531" height="431" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ravi Shankar, the widely revered Indian Sitar Maestro, recently passed away aged 92.  George Harrison said of Ravi Shankar that he was the &#8216;&#8221;godfather of world music&#8221;&#8216;. Ravi Shankar delighted audiences for many decades with his soulfully uplifting performances. His music and life helped provide a bridge between the devotional music of India, and new audiences in the West.</p>
<div id="attachment_1923" style="width: 307px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1923" title="Ravi Shankar and Sri Chinmoy an early meeting" alt="ravi-early-years" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/ravi-early-years1.jpg" width="297" height="267" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ravi Shankar and Sri Chinmoy &#8211; an early meeting.</p></div>
<p>Ravi Shankar first met with Sri Chinmoy in 1973; and in later years, the two friends met on a number of occasions. In September, 2002, Sri Chinmoy offered Ravi Shankar the <a href="http://www.srichinmoy.org/service/u_thant_peace_award/index.html">U Thant Peace award</a>. An award Sri Chinmoy gave to inspirational people who had promoted peace and harmony in the world. On giving the award, Sri Chinmoy said of Ravi Shankar:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Every single day, your colossal music soul swiftly travels the universe and prayerfully gathers a huge bouquet of twinkling stars to place at the Feet of the Absolute Lord Beloved Supreme … Ravi Shankar the musician and God the Supreme Musician sleeplessly communicate with each other through the language of love.” (<a href="http://www.srichinmoy-reflections.com/pilgrims-of-eternity">Pilgrims of Eternity</a>)</p>
<div id="attachment_1921" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1921" alt="ravi_shankar-srichinmoy" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/ravi_shankar.jpg" width="360" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sri Chinmoy, Ravi Shankar Oct 2002</p></div>
<p><span id="more-1918"></span></p>
<p>A few months later, after meeting Ravi Shankar in October 2002, Sri Chinmoy said of Ravi Shankar:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Each time you play, you unreservedly inspire us to drink deep Nectar-Delight far beyond this world.” (<a href="http://srichinmoy-reflections.com/ravi-shankar-concert-2002">Anahata Nada</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="ravi shankar sri chinmoy" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/ravi-2-shankar.jpg" width="300" height="208" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1924" style="margin-left: 13px; margin-right: 13px;" alt="S6" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2012-12-13-at-19.31.16.png" width="150" />During this October meeting in PS86, Queens, New York, Sri Chinmoy and his students performed for Ravi Shankar and his wife Sukanya. This included the powerful vocal <em>Ravi Shankar Song</em>. Sri Chinmoy also played on a new esraj-like instrument.</p>
<p>Ravi Shankar later blessed and named the instrument <em>“Chinmoy Beena”</em>. There were also several musical performances by Sri Chinmoy’s students. The following evening Ravi Shankar and his daughter Anoushka, reciprocated, performing a special concert for Sri Chinmoy his students and invited guests under a huge tent at Aspiration-Ground.  Recording at Radio Sri Chinmoy &#8211; <a href="http://www.radiosrichinmoy.org/10174/pranati-obeisance/">Pranati Obeisance</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s mahasamadhi, Ravi Shankar said of his dear friend.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“It is such a shock and I cannot believe that brother Chinmoy is gone and that we would not see or hear him anymore. He had so much love for everyone. I am going to miss him always. I wish his soul to find ultimate peace in Heaven” (<a href="http://www.srichinmoy.org/kind_words/music_tributes/index.html">www.srichinmoy.org</a>)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World harmony leader Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s lifetime of service to bettering the world was recognized last week in Caguas, Puerto Rico when a 2 metre high statue was dedicated in the Botanical and Cultural Garden of Caguas. The life-sized statue sculpted by British artist Kaivalya Torpy depicts Sri Chinmoy in a dhoti with hands raised in prayer and  joins other statues previously dedicated around the world in places such as Bali, Norway and Mexico.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Caguas-Mayor-Miranda-Marin-with-statue-of-Sri-Chinmoyandpeace-torch-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-699" title="Caguas Mayor Miranda Marin with statue of Sri Chinmoyandpeace torch-1" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Caguas-Mayor-Miranda-Marin-with-statue-of-Sri-Chinmoyandpeace-torch-1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="282" /></a></p>
<p>The Mayor of Caguas, William Miranda Marin, received the World Harmony Run Torch and was presented with the Torchbearer Award by Run organizers. During the ceremony, Mayor Marin stated, “Sri Chinmoy will live for eternity…It is a privilege for us to have this beautiful statue of Sri Chinmoy in these gardens. We are subscribers to the same philosophy that Sri Chinmoy promoted during more than 40 years of his service to humanity.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/P2140037.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-701" title="P2140037" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/P2140037.jpg" alt="" width="272" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>An international choir performed songs composed by Sri Chinmoy in honour of Puerto Rico and a procession of representatives displayed the many nations represented within the group of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s students in attendance.</p>
<p>Those present from the Sri Chinmoy Centres International found it significant and appropriate that a statue be dedicated in the place where his worldwide mission began. Sri Chinmoy founded his first centre for meditation in Puerto Rico in 1966 &#8211; they now cover the globe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/P2160277.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-700" title="P2160277" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/P2160277.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>The statue is located in a corner of the botanical garden ringed with trees and near a small brook.  It will serve as a grove for reflection and cultural activities for the garden&#8217;s many visitors.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hari Om!<br />
The good old Yoga Masters are dead and gone today.<br />
Beloved Sri Chinmoy was one of the last of the old Rishis from India. Old Narayananandaji (1902-1988) from The RamaKrishna mission, and Chinmoy (1931-2007), were the 2 best yoga teachers I have ever met personally. Chinmoy was a great musician too. We saw him in Oslo Norway two times.<br />
God bless you people out there!<br />
Long live the memory of Sri Chinmoy.<br />
A very peaceful man with a good condition…<br />

<blockquote><p>Dearest Revered Guruji,<br />
When you lifted me up on Nov ‘03 in Singapore,<br />
I was inspired to perform in Raga Revathi a piece titled, “Manida Janmam”. After performing it on my Bansuri (flute) and having realised that the melody came not just through my fingers but from my heart instead. it was a radical change showered from YOU, the divine grace. You then lifted both my late mother (my source of inspiration in my musical journey) and myself again. How fortunate indeed I am to get this rarest opportunity by YOU who gave me an ‘ode to joy’ to perform every time now from my heart. You not only being a great Guru, but all the human being in the highest sense of the term, much above and much nobler and who is the symbol of the glory of human life ~ Dearest Guruji, I’ve realised the devotion and dedication to music even more absolute self-surrender as my music is Thine.<br />
Revered Guruji, as you attain Maha Samadhi, I shall venture further my musical journey with Thy Guidance and continue my humanitarian service to mankind that am always eagerly aspire to do so. That same Revathy piece which I performed in front of you was dedicated to you along with my senior students during the 9-day Dassera Festival in various temples here as my tribute to YOU.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>My brother and I live in Cyprus and are not disciples of Sri Chinmoy. In 1981 we attended a group meditation in Queens New York. The Guru had just come back from his Christmas holidays. During the meditation he gave us the MOST important experience of our lives. A wave of light from his third eye filled the room, entered our bodies, our minds, our souls. It cleansed us and filled us with so much love. We felt like balloons filled with love. We think he gave us a glimpse of enlightenment. We loved everybody and everything. We felt so much full of wisdom. We even knew what infinity is. Our lives have never been the same since then. We still have his photos in our house and often pray to him. My father who is sick in hospital also has his photo by his bed. We never saw Sri Chinmoy since then but we both agree he was the most important person we ever happened to meet. Sri Chinmoy, even though we were not your disciples we love you and we want to thank you for everything. George and Petros, Cyprus</p></blockquote>
<p>George &amp; Petros Petropoulos</p>

<blockquote><p>I received Initiation from Guru back in the early 1970’s!<br />
Even though I did not remain at the Center, Guru’s influence has been the bed-rock of my spiritual existence.<br />
I recognized him immediately when First I saw him.<br />
We never understand what we have until it is no longer available.<br />
Sri Chinmoy’s Spirit must indeed, be eternal!</p></blockquote>

<p><em> (The following tribute comes from Ted Corbitt, who is known as the &#8216;father of modern ultrarunning&#8217; having raced in and helped organise races for almost 50 years. He is still active at the age of 87, competing in a 24-hour race as recently as 2003)</em></p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: Salutations and goodbye, for now.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy was a unique character who chose paths that had upbeat effects around the entire world.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy was productive in the expression of his talents. No one matched his artistic and physical output. Sri Chinmoy and his helpers did a unique service in the conduction of many long distance runs allowing many runners around the world to express themselves running. They have shown the world how it is done. They are unmatched.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy exploited the hours given to him. His time on earth is unforgettable among those who knew him.</p>
<p><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> We can remember and appreciate that Sri Chinmoy worked his many talents around the world, to be shared by many groups of people on the globe&#8230;.</span></p>
<p>Ted Corbitt<br />

<p>(From one who appreciated the upgrade in peoples lives provided by Sri Chinmoy’s efforts.)</p>
<p><span id="more-91"></span></p>
<hr /><strong>Edie Weinstein-Moser</strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>In August of 1996, (in time for his 65th birthday) I had the honor of being invited to interview Sri Chinmoy at his center in NY and enjoy the lovingly prepared food at his restaurant called Annam Brahma. He was gracious and welcoming, with a delightful sense of humor, as a friend and I had driven 3 hours from our home in Bucks County, PA.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Some excerpts from the interview that still tickle me:<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>When he entered the room, I recall a feeling of surprise; my impression of him was not what I expected. There was a sense of serenity that emanated from him, yet an air of grounded-ness as well. Not merely concerned with cosmic matters, he had his mind on the practical. After he took my hands and bowed slightly, he asked if we had eaten since our arrival. I told him that I was anxious to conduct the interview. He nodded in agreement, but responded “Then you eat.” His physical body was not what I had anticipated. He was not muscle-bound, as I would have envisioned a weightlifter’s physique to be. Decked out in a pale blue workout suit, he cut a rather compact figure. While we spoke, he sat across the table, lightly squeezing a grip strengthener., alternating hand to hand. His eyes were closed a good bit of the time, but on occasion, they would widen in surprise or delight.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Some memorable quotes: “Inside my body is a soul, inside my body is God. So, I have to feed the living presence of God, the Divine in me, my Inner Pilot. That is the highest attitude. I am all gratitude to my creator.”<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>“Peace is something I get not by possessing, but by sharing. If I have an iota of peace that I share with you, then I will be happy. By loving the world the way mother loves a child…I love a flower, I feel that the flower is also loving me. Why do I get joy? I am getting something from the flower and giving something to it.”<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>He then honored me with this statement:” I am glad to be given the opportunity to be of service to you, to your Inner Pilot, which is my God as well. God brought you here as an instrument of His. Two days ago, I met Mother Teresa. In this moment, she grabs my head like this (He makes a motion, placing one hand along either side of his head, as if to bring it down for a kiss on the top, as a mother would do for her child). The next moment, she is playing the role of a sister. The next moment she goes like this. (He folds his hands in front of his chest in prayer posture and bows his head) She knows we are on the same boat, the boat of peace on the river of peace.”<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>A few days ago, a friend was in my office, and I was showing her a poster that hangs on the wall from a concert he gave in Philadelphia that Fall. He is gazing upward, serenely, as if listening to a call that he alone can hear. I honor this man of peace and compassion with a huge heart that inspires me and helps me recognize that when tapped into that Source. At the time, I had not known that Sri Chinmoy had passed. He obviously is still speaking.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Namaste</p>
<p>Edi</p>
<hr /><em>(This tribute is from Shivaram Trichur, who was a colleague of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s in the Indian consulate where he worked immediately upon his arrival to the U.S in 1964, and who became Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s disciple a few years later.) </em></p>
<p>In 1964 June walking across the reception area of the Indian Consulate in New York during a conversation I asked my shy quiet compatriot.’what exactly is God”? He answered “Isn’t it consciousness”? I stepped back and looked at him holding by breath. Many years later when I read another great saint’s life this answer shone with the clarity and stamp of truth-certainty of one only with direct experience of pure Consciousness could have given.<br />
What all happened between 1964 and October 11, 2007 will fill many pages. On October 12 standing in front of Guru in Yoganidra, my heavy heart was comforted by those two eyes which gently opened a little several times as if to recognize the friend who asked that question more than 43 years earlier.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Gratitude is the word I have learnt to spell and the meaning of which I am learning a little deeper everyday, from Guru<br />
Eternal gratitude from one who was called friend, brother, son and disciple</p>
<p>&#8211; Shivaram Trichur</p>

disciples from Sedona, Arizona. I was playing harp<br />
today at an opening Peace Ceremony &amp; thinking of<br />
Sri Chinmoy and how his heart is so full of Love and Light that he was promoted for all of his Great Work<br />
and Love he always Shares with One and All in so many beautiful ways.<br />
I feel that Sri Chinmoy is now on his Cosmic Vacation<br />
I’m very sure he is very happy and wants us all to be happy too.<br />
He is still with us only on another vibration. We are so very blessed to have all his beautiful blessings.<br />
I am so happy to have met him and have been so graced and inspired by him in so many ways.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I remember knowing Guru from the time I was a child — I lived directly up the street from him on 85th drive. I remember mostly, his warm and engaging smile when he would be on his walking regimes and wave to me. He was always very kind to the neighborhood children!</p>
<p>I now live out of state, and just received the sad word of his passing. He is in my thoughts and prayers, as is the entire community of Sri Chinmoy’s followers.</p>
<p>May God bless you all at this time of loss. Be at peace; he will continue to guide and inspire you!</p></blockquote>

<p>Rev. Worthington Enslow</p>
<p>~</p>
<blockquote><p>Let us not be sadden by the passing of a great spritual leader, but rather rejoice in his life and the message he leaves us. His body may no longer be in this realm but his spirit lives on in all who he touched. His unconditional love of the Supreme and humanity transcends death and so does our love for him. May we all each in our own way, carry forth his message of peace, love and harmony to all we come in contact with and work together to create a better world. Gurudev, may the influence of your great heart, speak to us from beyond the veil of eternity.<br />
Peace be upon you.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Since 1986 I have had a picture of this inspiring and inspired man, this Avatar of Peace, in my home; and privileged too on a number of occasions to have met and experienced his unique presence.<br />
It was life changing.<br />
Sri Chinmoy’s abiding love, compassion and humility is indelibly etched on my life experience and, like so many others, I owe a debt of gratitude for his life.<br />
In particular for imparting his eternal values of oneness, for his teachings and for his total understanding of the human condition.<br />
My hope for us all is that the Smile of the Beyond which is now his will soon be enjoyed by all humanity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although I did not know you, your radiance reverberates forever in the hearts of my friends who did. I cannot wait to meet all the others, for I feel a part of your tribe of love and light and peace. Truly your legacy is immortally enshrined in the now and future human spirit.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Sad news I received yesterday from a friend who informed me of the Sri Chinmoy’s passing. I shall keep a found souvenir of my various ultra races in New York, including the 1 000 miler world championship in 1988, when Guru’s presence and support were key to my personal success. Sri Chinmoy certainly deserves respect and admiration for the good he has done and for the inspiration he provided to other individuals in the achievement of their own personal goals. He knew how to motivate people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michel Careau</p>
<p>~</p>
<blockquote><p>Although Sri Chinmoy was not my spiritual leader, I have witnessed over the past 20 years, his profound gracious, loving and peac3ful effect he has on his followers. My only wish is that Sri Chinmoy be an exception, and be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize this year, that he is a front runner for, posthumously. My sincere condolences to all his disciples worldwide, with extra heartfelt sympathies for his disciples in San Francisco.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Diving from Sri Chinmoy’s Platform</p>
<p>Timid toes touch shallow shoals of bliss.<br />
In the vast, bottomless river of the Divine,<br />
Mother and Sri Aurobindo coax us<br />
From somnambulist shores.<br />
Teaching us to swim,<br />
They carry us floating through floods,<br />
Drowning only our fears.</p>
<p>Surfing on his flute,<br />
Sri Chinmoy says the water is warm.<br />
I dive in—<br />
Breathing the ambrosian waters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bill Leon</p>
<p>~</p>
<blockquote><p>I was not a follower of Sri Chinmoy, but years ago, when I lived in Boston, he came to play at a local cathedral and I went and heard. In that part of the world, to hear and see anyone with a scrap of celeb status costs an arm and a leg, but Sri Chinmoy played for free. He spoke before playing, saying that his purpose there was not to amaze us with musicianship, but to facilitate our meditation, so meditate I did while he played. I could say that I enjoyed the experience, but I understand that enjoyment was not his purpose.</p>
<p>I am saddened by his passing. He was one decent chap.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I grew up in Jamaica Hills &#8211; down the street from Sri Chinmoy. I was fortunate to have met him as a child when he performed several concerts at night in my elementary school (one with Carlos Santana). It was a very moving experience. My whole family was saddened to learn of his passing because of the years we spent living in the same neighborhood as he and his followers, who we always found to be peaceful and kind people. May he be forever at peace.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>What you have given my brother whilst he has been your disciple, I see a model for what you have given to humanity. Your message and gifts have done much to bring the earth closer to a sense of oneness. I hope those you have touched in your time here are inspired to open their hearts even more and sing your message even louder with your passing from the physical world.</p>
<p>Eternal gratitude for the inspiration, peace and love you have given the world and me.</p></blockquote>
