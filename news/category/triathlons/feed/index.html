				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the beginning of July the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team in Bristol, UK, organized their first triathlon. The event was targeted to beginning triathletes, combining a 246 meter swim (or 8 lengths of an outdoor pool), a 17K bike ride and a 3K run. One hundred aspiring triathletes competed, which was the maximum number of participants allowed. Despite the rainy weather the event was a great success and will become a yearly feature.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;I have the deepest admiration for those who participate in triathlons. Swimming reminds us of our spiritual life. Right now we are swimming in the sea of ignorance, but we are praying to our Beloved Supreme and meditating on Him to be able to swim in the sea of Light and Delight. When we are running, we are reminded of our birthless and deathless journey along Eternity&#8217;s Road. Then, while we are cycling, we are reminding ourselves of evolution, of how the world is evolving in cycles&#8221; (</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>See also: previous entry: <a href="/2007/03/sri-chinmoy-triathlon-festival-2007.html">Sri Chinmoy Triathlon Festival</a></p>
<p>For the last few years it has been my task to set up swim courses. Measuring distance on the water is the key factor, and a few different methods have been employed over the years. A cumbersome, now obsolete  method, used a string on a reel with a counter attached. The string<br />was tied to a swim buoy and, as you moved away, the counter told you how far away you were. Laser-sighting binoculars were much better. You aim them at an object, press a button, and instantly you have a digital readout of the distance. But they were expensive, and not<br />waterproof! One pair met their watery end in Lake Burley Griffin. So, for the last few years I have used a small GPS from a camping store. It&#8217;s accurate to within a few metres, it&#8217;s waterproof, and it floats.</p>
<p>I put all the swim buoy weights into the boat. They weigh about 20kg each, and are made from concrete. Then I inflated all the swim buoys. They are big yellow plastic cone shaped things. To inflate them, I use the high-tech method of employing a 20-year old vacuum cleaner with<br />the hose stuck in the other end, so it blows air instead of sucking. I motored out onto the lake with a big procession of buoys towing along behind.</p>
<p>I had been congratulating myself on having worked out all the swim courses in advance. I had to set a 500m course for the Sprint Triathlon, a 1.5km course for the &#8220;Classic&#8221; Tri, and a 3.2 km course for the Champions Challenge. The Sprint required only one swim buoy. The Classic required four. These courses I had set in previous years. The Champions Challenge was a new course. I had done some measurements on a map, and it seemed to be a simple extension of the Classic course. I had designed m maps for the race, and they had been on the<br />web for months.</p>
<p>After setting the Sprint and Classic, I discovered, to my surprise, that there wasn&#8217;t enough room for the course I had planned. If you got <a href="https://au.srichinmoyraces.org/" target="_blank">Champs Challenge course</a> you can see the course I wanted to set. Instead, I had to go a long way eastwards to set the first Champions Challenge buoy. When I say first, I mean the first buoy that isn&#8217;t also part of the Classic course. Okay, it&#8217;s not so easy to explain. I always end up with a sheet of paper full of figures from the GPS readings as I try to figure out the trigonometry. By the time I finished it was after dark.<br />All the <a href="/sri-chinmoy-centre/index.html">Sri Chinmoy Centre</a> members, locals and visitors, were at the Centre for a meditation. I had toyed with the idea that I could motor up Sullivans Creek in the boat and get to the Centre that way. But I hadn&#8217;t brought my clothes for meditation, and anyway it was too late by the time that I had finished with the swim courses&#8230;.</p>
<p>Wow! This is an exciting post! All about GPS readings and swim buoys!<br />Hopefully the next one will feature topics with a more general appeal!</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s Sri Chinmoy Triathlon Festival has just wrapped up in<br />Canberra, Australia. But this is not really a race report. It&#8217;s just<br />some words about the experience of helping to make it happen. We<br />started  setting up for the event last Wednesday, in the idyllic<br />environment of Yarralumla Bay. The green lawn slopes gently down to<br />the strip of golden sand that borders Lake Burley Griffin. Big leafy<br />trees provide shade and respite from the often merciless summer sun.<br />Small picturesque islands can be seen from the shore. Swans and<br />various waterfowl glide placidly across the surface of the lake.<br />Sometimes you can recognise a swan family you saw a few months back,<br />when a little troop of fuzzy grey cygnets trailed behind their elegant<br />parents. This time the young are bigger, two-thirds adult size, but<br />still covered in grey down, yet to sprout the sleek black feathers<br />that signify maturity.</p>
<p>This year the traditional long-course event was replaced with a longer<br />one, featuring a 3.2km swim, 120km ride, and 30km run. The weather in<br />the week leading up to the event was strange and unpredictable. The<br />almost constant fine weather was broken by thunderstorms. Then on<br />Tuesday Canberra experienced its most ferocious hailstorm in decades.<br />The next morning saw drifts of hail piled up in the city, more than a<br />foot deep in some places, like snow. Very, very odd conditions to be<br />found at the tail end of a typically hot summer down under. But all<br />this ice and water had the beneficial effect of topping up our lake,<br />which had been quite low of late.</p>
<p>So after the dramatic leadup, we were blessed with clear blue skies<br />when the first race started on Friday. The childrens&#8217; Joyathon races<br />are a fun way to start the Festival, with many youngsters lining up<br />for their first triathlon. Most of the bikes are too small to fit on<br />the  bicycle racks, so they are parked underneath, using the kickstand&#8230;</p>
