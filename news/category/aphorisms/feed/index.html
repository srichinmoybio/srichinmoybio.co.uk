				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center;">&#8220;When I love a man, I live within his ever-blossoming heart.      </p>
<p>When I hate a man, he lives within my ever-torturing vital.    </p>
<p>Love has a power of its own. It can be used to see and feel both the lowest and the highest.    </p>
<p>The noblest love of man constitutes his purest vision of God.    </p>
<p>Love is always expensive, whether heavenly or earthly.    </p>
<p>Like death, manâ€™s love is capable of levelling all ranks&#8221;</p>

<p>These short aphorisms of Sri Chinmoy were composed in 1963, one year before he travelled to America. Between 1965 and 1968 the aphorisms were published as a series in AUM magazine In 1972 they were published under 1  volume &#8220;Eternity&#8217;s Breath&#8221;</p>
<p>The book also includes short essays such as &#8220;<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/resources/experience_at_14.html">An experience of the author at age 14</a>&#8220;</p>
