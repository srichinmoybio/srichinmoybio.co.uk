				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, volunteers from the Slovakian branch of Oneness-Heart-Tears and Smiles visited a children&#8217;s hospital in Russia to offer free entertainment to the children being treated there.</p>

<p>One of the entertainers was Vlado Kulíšek, from Trencin, who works as a a professional mime artist. He often performs without charge for children who are severely ill or who have experienced suffering as the result of a natural disaster.</p>
<p>Recently, he has performed in Japan, in areas affected by the devastating tsunami, and in orphanages in Vietnam. This last journey was to St. Petersburg, Russia, where he played at the Raisa Maximova Gorbachev oncology clinic.</p>

<p>Vlado said of the experience:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;It was great to be able to put a smile on the faces of so severely ill children.  &#8220;The most difficult visits were with children in their rooms. These children are hospitalized in their rooms because their illness is most severe and the most difficult cases. But all children promised to me that they will meet with me in the future &#8211; right in the theater, to participate in the entertaining fun program.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.onenessheart.org/">The Oneness-Heart-Tears and Smiles</a> &#8211; is a humanitarian organisation founded by Sri Chinmoy. It often offers aid and friendship to people around the world, who have been affected by poverty and natural disasters.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.onenessheart.org/">Oneness Heart Tears and Smiles</a> is a humanitarian programme founded by Sri Chinmoy. To date, it has distributed humanitarian aid to nearly 150 countries around the world. There is now a new <a href="http://www.onenessheart.org/">website</a>, which in the future, will host recent programmes and initiatives.</p>
<p>To Sri Chinmoy charitable and humanitarian projects were always an expression of a oneness heart which seeks to identify with others.</p>
<blockquote><p>“With our loving hearts, we identify and become one with what others are. This power that loves can solve world problems. This power is full of self-giving, not with a sense of sacrifice, but with the feeling of serving all humanity as our own brothers and sisters. Through both our loving silence and devoted service, we contribute to the betterment of the entire world.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One initiative of the Oneness Heart Tears and Smiles programme is the initiative to link children from developed countries with children who have experienced poverty or natural disasters. This programme is more than just sharing material aid. It seeks to develop friendship between children of very different cultures.</p>
