<p>Sri Chinmoy felt that music was a universal way to bring peace and hapiness into the world.</p>
<p>In the spiritual world, next to meditation is music, the breath of music. Meditation is silence, energising and fulfilling. Silence is the eloquent expression of the inexpressible. &#8211; Sri Chinmoy</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is President Nelson Mandela&#8217;s 95th birthday, and the Sri Chinmoy Centre would like to add its best wishes to the millions of birthday greetings from all around the world. Sri Chinmoy was a great admirer-friend of President Mandela, and the two had several warm and significant meetings.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2211" alt="nelson_mandela" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/nelson_mandela.jpg" width="370" height="235" /></p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy wrote a book called <em>Nelson Mandela: The Pinnacle-Pillar of Mother Earth</em> in his honour &#8211; below are some of the poems from the book:</p>
<p>“He tells poorer than the poorest human beings<br />
In every possible way:<br />
&#8216;Let us dream together.<br />
The Golden Dawn<br />
Will soon burst forth!&#8217;”</p>
<p>“President Mandela&#8217;s very name<br />
Builds a hope-cathedral<br />
In the heart of despair-flooded humanity.”</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I cannot express in words my joy! What you are doing is in the interest of the entire humanity and the world</em>.&#8221; &#8211; Nelson Mandela to Sri Chinmoy, meeting in South Africa, 1996</p>
<p>The above photo shows Sri Chinmoy and Nelson Mandela and his wife, Mama Graca holding the torch of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run, which Sri Chinmoy founded in 1987. While holding the torch President Mandela said: &#8220;We are with you in upholding peace, which brings solace to many people throughout the world. It doesn&#8217;t matter what language they speak. I think peace is one of the things that is going to save the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement released on his birthday, President Mandela&#8217;s health is reported to be steadily improving.</p>

<p>There were many speakers at the ceremony. A representative of Bishop of Dili opened the proceedings. The World Harmony Run Torch-Bearer Award was presented to the current Prime Minister, H.E. Xanana Gusmão, and Timor-Leste&#8217;s first Prime Minister, H.E. Mari Alkatiri.</p>

<p>There was a very nice moment where Mr Gusmão, ran from the entrance the entrance with the Torch, and passed it to Dr Alkatiri, who in turn ran up the steps of the parliament and gave it to the President, H.E. Taur Matan Ruak.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="IMG_2556" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2556.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></p>
<p>A choir of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s students sang a song Sri Chinmoy had written in honour of East Timor, and also his song and &#8216;A New World of Peace&#8217;. The President then cut the ribbon to inaugurate the statue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every Christmas, Sri Chinmoy used to travel with his students to different countries on a Christmas retreat, a tradition his students still honour today. Noivedya Juddery gives an account of his retreat experience in Indonesia.<span id="more-1980"></span></p>
<div style="width: 627px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " alt="Kettledrum - 20 January 2013_Page_2_Image_0002" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Kettledrum-20-January-2013_Page_2_Image_0002.jpg" width="617" height="503" /><p class="wp-caption-text">As well as meditation functions 3 times a day, the location offered opportunities for running, swimming, table tennis and other leisure activities.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left">The Indonesian island of Bintan, a short ferry ride from Singapore, is the kind of palm-lined tropical paradise where many people (including some Australians and many Singaporeans) can escape from the busy urban world. For the bulk of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s students, who prefer their travels to be exciting rather than restful, it might not seem to be the most obvious destination. While the island is charming, and the people are sweet and friendly, it is not clearly immersed in spirituality like Bali, or the site of brilliant landmarks like Yangon. However, like Pangkor Island, the relaxing world of Bintan is perhaps an ideal Christmas Trip location. Directly outside the hotel, there is little to distract us from the reason that we are there: not as tourists, but as spiritual aspirants, fortunate to be on a dynamic and versatile Path of the Heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Mind you, within the resort, there is plenty to keep us busy. Beautiful running trails, surrounded by green forest. Energetic beach activities. A buffet restaurant serving a variety of dishes on par with some of the best food from any Christmas Trip. In case we find ourselves indulging in the meals too much – a perfectly reasonable vice – we are lucky in that we enjoy sporting activities more than other spiritual people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="races" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/races.jpg" width="600" height="205" /><p class="wp-caption-text">There were mens&#8217; and womens&#8217; 1 and 2 mile races every week as well as a swim-run race</p></div>
<p>The evenings, as always, offered theatrical productions of spiritual stories, a highlight of which was a 20-minute dramatisation by Abhinabha (from the Netherlands) of Sri Chinmoy’s story <em>The Scholar and the Thief</em>. Theatre people often suffer for their art, and Abhinabha was no exception, dislocating his shoulder during a particularly vigorous rehearsal the night before. Fortunately, as one of the cast, I can honestly say that it was all worth it. (Then again, I didn’t dislocate my shoulder.) The night had already delivered a few surprises in the play-world, with Satyakarma’s short play starting with the usual craziness, then ascending to become perhaps the most soulful play of the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="width: 290px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img alt="yoga" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/yoga.jpg" width="280" height="325" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Amalendu, a qualified yoga instructor, offered yoga classes every morning for his fellow students</p></div>
<p>However many hundreds of plays have now been performed at Christmas Trips, there is no end to the embellishments of Sri Chinmoy’s tales. This was never more obvious than on Improv Night, organised by Sadadand, in which the entire audience was split into teams and given 20 minutes to perform one of Guru’s stories, with certain rules (such as the presence of the line “We all live in a yellow submarine”&#8230; well, naturally). Some of the results &#8212; such as a girls’ play that was mostly a cross between a dream sequence and a Russian ballet, and another in which Susebika (Auckland) hilariously interrupted the story by dancing around and cheerfully repeating “We all live in a yellow submarine!” for no discernible reason (apart from the rules) &#8212; had to be seen to be believed. In fact, I saw them, and I’m still not convinced I believe them. But despite (or because of) the lack of preparation time, pure entertainment was the order of the evening.</p>
<p>Also in Bintan, Hridayinee gave a soulful (but regal) performance in her own play, Grahak added another pirate play to their continuing adventures, and Prachar gave a talk (not a play) in which he named three things that he has learned on Guru’s Path… but the first of those was “I know nothing”, so we can’t be sure about the rest.</p>
<p>As I write this, we still have a few days to enjoy Bintan – though for the next two days, most students will be across the water in Singapore for the World Harmony Run and the Music of the Heart concert. For now, we enjoy the sunshine and greenery of a meditative paradise, with the smiles of the Indonesian people to make us feel at home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grahak Cunningham, a four-time finisher and 2012 winner of the world&#8217;s longest certified road race, has just published <em>Beyond the Marathon: Insights into the Longest Foot Race in the World.<span id="more-1935"></span></em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="grahak" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/grahak.jpg" width="268" height="410" />Loaded with training tips, anecdotes and race stories, this book takes you on the journey from Grahak&#8217;s first race in 2007 as a multiday novice to his ultimate victory in 2012.</p>
<p>The Self- Transcendence 3100 Mile Race is held every year on a concrete footpath around an 883-metre block in Queens, New York. The race was founded in 1997 by fitness guru Sri Chinmoy as a testament to the endless possibilities of the human spirit.</p>
<p>A quote from the book cover: &#8220;<em>Competitors must contend with boredom, fatigue, torrential deluges, extreme pain, injuries and sleep deprivation—but most of all, they have to deal with themselves. Outwardly for their efforts they will receive a plastic trophy and a t-shirt; inwardly, they make a lifetime of progress.</em>&#8220;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his first race representing the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team, Martin Fryer, established a new World Record for men over 50 in a 24-hour track race of 247.59 km (153 miles, 1487 yards) in the invitational Soochow 24-Hour track race in Taiwan.<span id="more-1930"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1931 alignright" alt="martin1" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/martin1.png" width="285" height="329" /> The old record was 247.21 km, set back in 1985 by Englishman, Dave Cooper. Martin described the conditions in Taiwan as the worst in which he has ever run – 23 hours of rain out of the 24, with really strong winds and an inch of water covering the track for much of the race.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="martin2" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/martin2.png" width="282" height="299" />One of his toughest moments was around the 15-hour point. “I could see my lap times getting slower and slower and my heart was starting to sink with the thought of enduring this for another 9 hours or so,” he later wrote. “As so often happens, this state of self-centredness was dissolved by the sight of a rain-soaked runner in Lane 2 who had his head down and was dragging one of his legs along the track surface.” This was 28-year-old Malaysian runner Cheng Zhee Long, who suffers from cerebral palsy. “The presence of his humble determination hit me like a tidal wave.” Martin recalled. Ultimately, he says he had one of his best ever races, with his consciousness always focused and clear.</p>
<p>“A period of reflection after the race made me realise that it wasn’t so much the achievement that gave me the joy,” he wrote, “but rather the whole process of being immersed in this wonderful, collective human consciousness embodying spirit, aspiration and joy.”</p>
