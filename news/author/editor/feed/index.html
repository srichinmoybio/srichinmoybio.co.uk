				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/1tootingstart.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-237" title="1tootingstart" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/1tootingstart.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="395" /></a></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy always saw sports &#8211; and running in particular &#8211; as tremendously beneficial to the spiritual life, both in terms of keeping the body healthy and for the opportunities it afforded for people to reach their highest potential. In 1977, he founded the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team to serve the worldwide running community, and it has since grown to be the largest organiser of endurance sports events in the world. One very popular race it organises is the 24 Hour Self Transcendence Race in London every October. Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team member Matthias Eckerle went over to help, and he has kindly provided us with this eyewitness report:</em></p>
<p>The race started at 12pm Saturday, continuing around a 400m track right through the night till 12pm the next day. The field of runners came from many different countries. As well as organising the race, there were also two members of the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team participating. One of the, Asprihanal Aalto from Finland, has the distinction of being a four-time winner of the world&#8217;s longest race, the 3100 Mile Self-Transcendence race. Alongside the faster runners, it was especially aspiring to see many older people also participating &#8211; the oldest was 77 years!</p>
<p>For me, it was a nice experience to take care of the runners and to meet their requests for coffee, tea and soup &#8211; even after hours of running most of them were still able to smile! With in a couple of hours, we knew the names of all the runners, and they really appreciated this personal treatment.</p>
<p>Some of them (including the winner) ran very fast in the beginning before slowing down towards the end of the race. Others were mre constant, including Asprihanal, who in the last hour put on a surprising burst of speed to run 7 kilometers in 40 minutes to end up in 7th place. One of our jobs as helpers is to run along with the runners forthe last 2 or 3 minutes to mark thir finishing spot &#8211; I was running with Asprihanal, and it was a very nice feeling &#8211; he really is a very humble guy who doesnt think of boasting about his considerable achievements.</p>
<p>The race was won by Chris Finhill covering a distance of 243km followed in 2nd place by Ireland&#8217;s Eoin Keith who ran 235km, breaking the Irish national record along the way. However, a race like this is really all about competing, and at the end everybody was honoured with a race medal and photo commemorating their achievement. It was very inspiring for me, and I think I will definitely work towards entering this race myself at some point in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Athletics inspiration&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Tatyana Lebedeva, winner of the triple jump in the Athens Olympics and two time silver medalist in Beijing, first met Sri Chinmoy in 2004. Recently, upon returning from the Beijing Olympics she gave a very nice interview with the International Athletics Federation where she talks about how Sri Chinmoy has encouraged her. “<em>His philosophy of  constant Self-Transcendence left a deep trace in my life, and I always try to improve myself, no matter how tired I may feel</em>.” she reflected in the interview. <em>“It is impossible to live only in sport. I need to learn a lot, so that when I finish my sports career, I would have a chance to bring real benefits to the sport of  athletics. This is my internal task and I formulated it thanks to the philosophy of  Sri Chinmoy.</em>” Tatyana has no intention of ending her athletics career just yet, and already has her sights fixed on Olympic gold in London in 2012. <a href="http://www.iaaf.org/news/kind=100/newsid=48037.html">Read interview here&#8230;</a></p>
<p><strong>Karteek swims channel for 9th time</strong><br />
Karteek Clarke from the Sri Chinmoy Centre in Edinburgh cmpleted the gruelling swim from Dover to Calais, making it his 9th time! Quite a few of Sri Chinmoy’s students have swum the channel, and in fact the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team (the sporting organisation founded by Sri Chinmoy as a service to the sporting community) holds the record for the team with the most Channel crossings.</p>
<p><strong>Gandharva Loka Orchestra</strong><br />
In April 2008 and again in August 2008, two beautiful concerts were performed in tribute to Sri Chinmoy and his music. These concerts, called ‘Songs of the Soul’ featured well known musicians such as Philip Glass, Roberta Flack, Boris Purushottama Grebenshikov and Kristin Hoffman. One highlight of both concerts was the Gandharva Loka Orchestra, a 75 member instrumental and choral ensemble of Sri Chinmoy’s students, performing dazzling orchestral arrangements of Sri Chinmoy’s songs which brought the audience to their feet. The orchestra are now scheduled for a European tour in November, taking in the cities of Berlin, Prague, Munich, Milan, Zurich and Heidelberg and a North American and Canadian tour next spring.</p>

<p>All across the world, plans are at an advanced stage to make the 2008 incarnation of the World Harmony Run an absolutely gigantic event. Already the run has made its way through South East Asia and the Middle East, and is currently in north Africa.</p>
<p>The European leg of the Run will begin in Rome at the end of March, and will visit over 50 countries on its route. Among the many events planned will be Guinness World record attempts in Dublin, Ireland and Cambridge, England.</p>
<p>The US run will begin on April 10 and cover all 50 states in a four month journey. At the end of April, the Oceania leg of the Harmony Run will embark upon an unprecedented journey around Australia, before continuing its journey in New Zealand in September. There will also be Canadian and Russian legs of the Run &#8211; making it an event which truly spans the globe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some photo albums have appeared on the Sri Chinmoy Centre site remembering aspects of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s life in different ways:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/news/jowan_mongolia.JPG" width="300" /></p>
<p> This picture is taken from a lovely photo album called &#8216;<a href="http://www.srichinmoycentre.org/gallery/members/jowan/ckg/" title="Beautiful Sri Chinmoy - album by Jowan">Beautiful Sri Chinmoy&#8217;</a> by Jowan Gauthier which is exactly that &#8211; beautiful pictures taken of Sri Chinmoy from his trip to St. Petersburg and his visit to Mongolia which took place in May of this Year. There is also a photo album by <a href="http://www.srichinmoycentre.org/gallery/members/projjwal/last+photos/" title="Photos by Projjwal">Projjwal Pohland</a>, who accompanied Sri Chinmoy on his last trip abroad to St. Petersburg and shares with us some beautiful photographs.</p>
<p><span id="more-93"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/news/Shakpura.jpg" width="450" /></p>
<p>Above, Ranjit Swanson has put up <a href="http://www.srichinmoycentre.org/gallery/members/ranjit/Shakpura" title="Sri Chinmoy in Shakpura - photos">photos remembering Sri Chinmoy</a> from a very different perspective: these pictures are of the tiny village of Shakpura, where Sri Chinmoy was born in 1931. At that time it was part of India; it now lies in modern-day Bangladesh. We can see Sri Chinmoy in a few of these photographs, including one particularly touching one where he his paying his respects to his parents&#8217; grave &#8211; both of them passed away within months of each other when he was only twelve years old. The photos are compiled from various sources, but most of them are taken by Ranjit and his brother Unmesh. There are some photos of Sri Chinmoy looking at some of the photographs they brought back; here he is pointing to the house where he grew up as a child.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/news/Photos.jpg" width="450" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left" align="left">In addition, Kedar Misani has arranged some of the photographs he has taken of Sri Chinmoy over the last 20 years into a two-part slideshow called &#8216;Aspects of an Eternal Journey&#8217;, which can be viewed on <a href="http://www.srichinmoy.tv/tv/208" title="Aspects of an Eternal Journey - sri chinmoy.tv">srichinmoy.tv&#8230;</a></p>

<p>Two recent prayer-poems written by Sri Chinmoy have recently come to light on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sri_Chinmoy_Inspiration/messages">Sri Chinmoy Inspiration Group</a> which seem especially poignant now given the Master&#8217;s passing.</p>
<p>Every Saturday morning whenever he was in New York, Sri Chinmoy would arrive at the 2 mile race held by his students to give out the prizes, which (in keeping with the participation-rather-than-winning focus of the races) usually consisted of a banana for each of the first three male and female finishers. Before giving the prizes, he would spontaneously compose a race prayer &#8211; sometimes this prayer would even be set to music! Sri Chinmoy composed his final race prayer on the morning of September 29th &#8211; here we can see how in the eye of a spiritual Master, the body&#8217;s trials and tribulations pale in comparison the soul&#8217;s delight:</p>
<p align="center"><em>The fever of the body<br />
Comes and goes.<br />
May my God-love-heart fever<br />
Remain forever and forever.</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>The fever of the body<br />
Is torture unbearable.<br />
My God-love-heart fever<br />
Is rapture unimaginable.</em></p>
<p align="center">(unofficial version, not yet published)</p>
<p>The second poem came to light during a meditation function held by Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s students in New York yesterday evening. For the past two years, Sri Chinmoy had been composing a series of rhyming couplets, one for every day of the year, in a collection  &#8216;My God-Hunger Cry&#8217;. This collection was not released in book form like most of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s output, but rather in sheets containing a week&#8217;s worth of poems.  Last night, the final sheet was made available during the meditation function, containing prayer-poems Sri Chinmoy had written for the week ending November 1; the following was the last poem on the sheet.</p>
<p align="center"><em>&#8220;Alas, my whole body has started to decay.<br />
But I am so happy that every day<br />
My Lord is getting younger day by day.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>A very beautiful recording of Sri Chinmoy singing the word &#8216;gratitude&#8217; over and over again, spontaneously putting music to the words as he sang, was played during Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s memorial ceremony, and again when his body was finally laid to rest. The recording took place on 13 April 1986, 22 years to the day Sri Chinmoy first arrived in America. Prachar Stegemann recalls the occasion:</p>
<p><em> &#8220;Guru was seated at our then-meeting place &#8216;Progress-Promise,&#8217; painting Jharna Kalas on a table in front of him. He spontaneously started humming, then singing the word &#8216;Gratitude&#8217; over and over. After a short while, Dhanu brought a microphone and placed it in front of Guru while he continued to sing and paint. From time to time you can hear the rapid sounds of the sponges Guru was using to paint with striking the paper.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;When the cassette was produced and ready for sale, Guru refused to charge any money for it. He simply gave it away to all&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>These recollections appeared on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sri_Chinmoy_Inspiration/messages">Sri Chinmoy Inspiration Group</a>, where students of Sri Chinmoy have recently penned many beautiful memories of their teacher and of the week-long vigil following his passing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.radiosrichinmoy.org/radio/204">Listen to this recording on Radio Sri Chinmoy&#8230;. </a></p>

<p>On Wednesday 3 October, Sri Chinmoy held a meditation function for his students at which many of the musical groups which usually play on Wednesdays performed. This was his first meditation function with his New York students since he returned from playing <a href="/news/sri-chinmoy/to-russia-with-love-a-flying-visit-from-sri-chinmoy/">musical concerts in St. Petersburg</a>, although he had been having walking meditations where students would arrive at his house and walk past in a loop whilst he meditated on them. During the function, Sri Chinmoy related many amusing incidents from his Russian trip.</p>
<p>On Friday, a meditation function was held where members of the general public were also invited to come along. Students that had been on Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s path for over 30 years were invited to come up and recite a short prayer or poem.</p>
<p>Another walking meditation took place on Saturday afternoon, and then a meditation function on Saturday night. Most of the Saturday night meditation function was taken up by improvised pieces of  spiritual theatre. A heart-warmingly funny play was performed by the theatre troupe led by Databir Watters and Abakash Konopiaty &#8211; consisting of incidents in the life of Databir! Databir is well known in the centre for being dynamism, enthusiasm and sweetness incarnate &#8211; he is in his sixties now, but is still the driving force behind the daily games of frisbee that a group of New York students have every day after their morning meditation. (<a href="http://www.ashrita.com/blog/archive/2007/10/01/behind-closed-doors/view" title="Sri Chinmoy tribute">Read Ashrita Furman&#8217;s blog</a> to find out what happened when someone tried to steal his wallet during a visit to Russia three years ago) Sri Chinmoy thought that this play was marvelous. Also that night, there was a play based on a story from the Mahabharata by Udar Robinson&#8217;s group &#8211; a year earlier, Sri Chinmoy had given them the name &#8220;Udar: the Unbounded Troupe&#8221;.</p>
<p>On Sunday, there was another walking meditation, and Sri Chinmoy also spoke at length on the importance of valuing the outer guidance of a meditation teacher.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 9 October, Sri Chinmoy hosted his last distinguished guest &#8211; Alan Nazareth, a retired Indian ambassador who had served his country in many different locations around the world, including the United States. Upon his arrival in the West in 1964, Sri Chinmoy worked in the Indian Consulate in New York for three years, before embarking full-time upon his life&#8217;s service to humanity. The Ambassador was Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s boss for a very short time in 1967 before he left, and in the ensuing years he came to quite a few of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s concerts and other activities. Alan Nazareth is currently managing trustee of the <a href="http://www.sarvodayatrust.org/" title="Sarvodaya International Trust">Sarvodaya International Trust</a> which works to uphold and spread the ideals espoused by Mahatma Gandhi, and he writes and lectures extensively on applying Gandhian ideals to the modern world. During his visit, he and Sri Chinmoy discussed the life&#8217;s work of Mahatma Gandhi, and Sri Chinmoy then presented his guest with an award honouring his years of service for his native country and for the world.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s creative output continued right up until the day before his passing &#8211; he composed several new songs on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wednesday night was the last meditation function that Sri Chinmoy held with his students. He spoke quite a lot during the function, wondering aloud about the outcome of the Nobel Prize that was to be announced in a couple of days and casting some humorous observations on the relationship between the two words &#8216;peace&#8217; and &#8216;harmony&#8217;. At that function, the poetry book <em>My Christmas-New Year-Vacation-Aspiration-Prayers, part 52</em> was made available for sale, consisting of 91 prayer-poems Sri Chinmoy wrote during his stay in Langkawi, Malaysia in early 2006. The ninety-first poem in this book, and the last poem published during Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s lifetime, has now attained an immortal status:</p>
<p align="center"><em>“My physical death<br />
Is not the end of my life &#8211;<br />
I am an eternal journey.”</em></p>
<p>One person who was present at the meditation function recalls Sri Chinmoy holding this book of poetry and wondering aloud &#8220;Will it ever end?&#8221;. We know know that was indeed a rhetorical question, for with Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s passing from this earthly plane, something has been set in motion which will propagate onwards into Eternity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s memorial service took place yesterday, attended by thousands of his students and dozens of luminaries from all around the world.</p>
<p>The ceremony opened with some minutes of meditation, filling the space with a deep and profound silence. This was followed by two of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s mantric songs peformed by his favourite musical group, an all female ensemble who have performed at venues all over the world.</p>
<p>Then Shivaram Trichur, a student of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s since the very earliest days of his coming to America, read out some ancient Indian <em>slokas</em>, or scriptural verses, concerning the immortality of the soul. Among them was this one, invoking the eternal relationship between a meditation teacher and his student:</p>
<blockquote><p>Saha nav avatu,<br />
Saha nav bhuknatu,<br />
Saha nav viryam haravavahai.</p></blockquote>
<p>(<em>May he protect us both.<br />
May he nourish us both.<br />
May we both work together with energy, indomitable and endless.</em>)<br />
 &#8211; from Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa Upanishad, translation by Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p>There were also performances by a group led by Satyajit Saha; this group performed arangements of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s music and writings every week at Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s meditation functions. This was followed by another group which performed an arrangement of <em>Smile, My Soul, Smile</em>, also written by Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p>Then luminaries from all around the world came up to pay their respects; many who could not attend sent heartfelt messages of appreciation and condolence which were read out. You can read many of those tributes <a href="http://www.srichinmoy.org/sri-chinmoy-1931-2007/tributes-to-sri-chinmoy" title="Sri Chinmoy death tributes">on SriChinmoy.org.</a></p>
<p>Then a choir of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s students sang the song &#8216;<a href="/news/sri-chinmoy/when-i-am-gone-away-a-song-by-sri-chinmoy/" title="Sri Chinmoy song">When I am Gone Away</a>&#8216;, that Sri Chinmoy asked be performed only upon his Mahasamadhi &#8211; the name given to the process by which spiritual Masters leave the body and enter into the soul&#8217;s world:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I am gone away,<br />
Remember me, O children sweet,</p>
<p>No, not because I failed,<br />
No, not because I cried,<br />
No, not because I tried,</p>
<p>No, not because I saw my Lord in you,<br />
No, not because I served my Lord in you,<br />
No, not because I fulfilled my Lord in you,</p>
<p>No, not because I was your Pilot true,<br />
No, not because I was your &#8216;Infinite&#8217; blue,</p>
<p>O but because my life was all gratitude, gratitude, gratitude<br />
To you, to you, my children sweet, to you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then one by one, all those present, students and visitors alike, filed up to the casket where Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s body lies, and placed a beautiful rose at the foot of the casket in appreciation of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s life work. In the background, a recording was played of Sri Chinmoy singing the mantra &#8216;Gratitude&#8217; over and over again, spontaneously composing the music as he sang.</p>
<p>Today (October 15th), people are still arriving to pay their respects to the earthly body Sri Chinmoy has left behind. Many musical groups that used to play soulful music at Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s meditation functions are now performing in the background for the visitors, creating an unearthly spiritual atmosphere in this beautiful warm and sunny day.</p>

<p>Sri Chinmoy wrote this song for his students in 1974, and asked that it be sung only upon his entry into Mahasamadhi and departure from this earth. During the memorial service for Sri Chinmoy yesterday, the song was sung by a choir of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s students in a way that brought heaven down to earth.</p>
<blockquote><p>When I am gone away,<br />
Remember me, O children sweet,</p>
<p>No, not because I failed,<br />
No, not because I cried,<br />
No, not because I tried,</p>
<p>No, not because I saw my Lord in you,<br />
No, not because I served my Lord in you,<br />
No, not because I fulfilled my Lord in you,</p>
<p>No, not because I was your Pilot true,<br />
No, not because I was your &#8216;Infinite&#8217; blue,</p>
<p>O but because my life was all gratitude, gratitude, gratitude<br />
To you, to you, my children sweet, to you.</p></blockquote>
