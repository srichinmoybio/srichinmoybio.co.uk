<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;I have the deepest admiration for those who participate in triathlons. Swimming reminds us of our spiritual life. Right now we are swimming in the sea of ignorance, but we are praying to our Beloved Supreme and meditating on Him to be able to swim in the sea of Light and Delight. When we are running, we are reminded of our birthless and deathless journey along Eternity&#8217;s Road. Then, while we are cycling, we are reminding ourselves of evolution, of how the world is evolving in cycles&#8221; (</p>

<p>The Joy-Days were created by Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s as a means to share the joys of the spiritual life and to be able to experience the power of group meditation.</p>
<p>Aside from the regular meditations there were many recreational activities, such as waterskiing, golfing, horseback riding and archery. The evenings were reserved for enlightening and entertaining program items, like music, theatre and inspirational video&#8217;s. In the morning a 5K race was organized around Lake Mondsee.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samunnati Nataliya Lehonkova from the Sri Chinmoy Centre in Ternopilska, Ukraine, has won the Edinburgh marathon last Sunday May 27th. Under warm conditions and on a hilly marathon course Samunnati completed the race in 2:39:46. It was her second marathon win in her running career, after a win in Poland in 2010. Also it was her second marathon in 6 weeks, after she had placed second in the marathon of Utrecht (The Netherlands) last April in a personal best of 2:39:20. She commented that now she will take some well-deserved rest.</p>
<div id="attachment_1628" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/self-transcendence/samunnati-wins-the-edinburgh-marathon/attachment/samunnati1/" rel="attachment wp-att-1628"><img class="size-large wp-image-1628" title="Samunnati's finish" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Samunnati1-500x333.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Samunnati breaks the tape in the Edinburgh marathon</p></div>
<p>Samunnati says that Sri Chinmoy inspires her in her running career. His philosophy of self-transcendence and going beyond one&#8217;s own preconceived limitations is a source of constant satisfaction to her. Sri Chinmoy encouraged his students to stay physically fit by running. Samunnati feels that the spiritual energy she receives from her daily meditation helps her in her running life. As Sri Chinmoy writes, &#8220;Through prayer and meditation we can develop intense will-power, and this will-power can help us do extremely well in our outer running.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the race members of the Sri Chinmoy Centre in Edinburg cheered her on. In the evening they celebrated her victory at their Sunday night meditation.</p>
