				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Zurich a happiness exhibition at the Vegelateria restaurant offered some insights into the quest for peace and happiness.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2231" alt="happiness-vegelateria" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/happiness-vegelateria-500x281.jpg" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The exhibition was inspired by the recent publication of a book called “<em>The Jewels of Happiness</em>”. The book was written by author, creative artist and renowned peace visionary Sri Chinmoy; it offers timeless wisdom and simple exercises for readers of all backgrounds. The complete audio book was released on March 12th with a launch on March 19th in New York City. Luminaries from all walks of life reach read a chapter from The Jewels of Happiness – including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Addwitiya Roberta Flack, Narada Michael Walden and Sudhahota Carl Lewis! Perfectly suited to our fast-paced lifestyles, The Jewels of Happiness includes short, insightful sections full of uplifting wisdom, charming aphorisms and easy to learn exercises. Each section stands on its own-with the entire book forming a tapestry of inspiration. “You can have the most joy just by imagining a child infinitely more beautiful than any child that you have seen in this world,” writes Sri Chinmoy. “You have inside you a child who is infinitely more beautiful. Just imagine it. While imagining it, you will get utmost joy.” Each of the 13 chapters in The Jewels of Happiness is on a different theme, such as peace, joy, patience, enthusiasm, sincerity, love, self-giving, humility, compassion, self-transcendence, simplicity and forgiveness.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">A.W. Dänzer at the opening of the “Happiness” Exhibition in Zurich</p>
<p>At the opening of the exhibition there was also a screening of the film “happy” by Roko Belic. The movie takes us on a journey from the swamps of Louisiana to the slums of Kolkata in search of what really makes people happy. Combining real life stories of people from around the world and powerful interviews with the leading scientists in happiness research, the film explores the secrets behind our most valued emotion.</p>
<p>Viewers’ Comments: <em>“Happy is one of those movies that will make you a better person for having seen it! An excellent, thought provoking movie that will grab your attention and your heart. This should be required viewing for everyone… There is a well done piece also about what doesn’t make kid’s happy. A great movie that will warm your heart, stir your soul and hopefully make you think about a practical application in your own life.”</em><br />
<em>“Important movie for the young. This is a movie where the subject matter is far more important than the quality of the movie itself (which is good). Had I received messages like this when I was young, I am sure I would have made fewer mistakes. Young persons understand that happiness is a life goal but they are often confused among conflicting messages on how to get there. By illustrating those who have achieved happiness as well as those who have not, the movie could potentially be very useful in helping young people make responsible and fulfilling life choices. So hopefully this little movie will be recognized as a motivational tool for the young and used in our classrooms and in other venues where teens might be receptive to its message.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Amazing. This film will make you happy! What an amazing feeling I had after watching this film. Film may not be the correct term in describing this passion project of genius, Roko Belic… I think the word experience is apt. Funded and executive produced by comedy directing legend Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura, Evan Almighty), Mr. Belic takes us around the globe in a search for what it means to be happy…and we find it! It is hard to put into words what he has accomplished in this riveting and eye-opening documentary, but we see and feel that true happiness is pretty easy to attain. Do yourself and your loved ones a favor.”</em></p>
<p>The exhibition will be on display in Zurich until October 17th 2013.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Zurich, members of the Sri Chinmoy Centre have recently founded a new ice-cream bar/ cafe in the centre of Zurich.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2069" alt="Vegelateria" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/Vegelateria.jpg" width="500" height="471" /></p>
<p>The Divine Enterprise was inaugurated in January 2013, in the centre  of Zurich. The name of the enterprise is  &#8220;The Sacred and Secret Way of Amazing Strength&#8221; which had  been given by Sri Chinmoy himself some 12 years ago. Abarita Dänzer,  owner of the &#8220;Secrets of Perfection-Flames&#8221; (Tofu Factory) took over a  former vegan bakery and take-away, and transformed it into a Vegelateria. A unique new ice-cream parlour,  where you can get more than 20 different ice creams, all vegan and  without conventional sugar. The local newspapers as well as the vegan  community are happy about the new place which for the moment holds only  10 seats in additional to the Take-Away. From Monday through Saturday  Pradatta Schrottenholzer and his helpers also offer hot meals, a daily  soup, salads and drinks. Abaraita plans to enlarge to 25 and later to 75  seats as soon as the needed requirements from the Health Authorities  are fulfilled. Also planned are regular monthly exhibitions and events  covering subjects such as health, nutrition, meditation, consciousness  and awareness.</p>
