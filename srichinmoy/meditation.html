			<h4>What is Meditation? </h4>
			<p>Common to all forms of meditation is the aspiration for a  seeker to experience and realise a higher state of consciousness. Meditation is  not an intellectual exercise; during meditation we seek to go beyond the domain  of the mind and experience the real self within us. When we experience real  meditation we become aware of the inner peace and joy that are at the centre of  our existence. </p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&ldquo;When you meditate, what you  actually do is to enter into a calm or still, silent mind.&rdquo;</p>
			  <p class="number">- Sri Chinmoy (1) </p>
			</div>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&ldquo;Meditation means our conscious  growth in the infinite. In meditation, the mind becomes calm and silent and we  consciously allow ourselves to be nurtured and nourished by Infinity itself.  Meditation is our conscious awareness of the Vast, and from this point of our  meditation we grow into the Vastness itself.&rdquo; </p>
			  <p class="number">- Sri Chinmoy [3] </p>
			</div>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>How To Quieten The Mind </h3>
			<p>In order to experience this divine consciousness, Sri Chinmoy  says the most important aspect of meditation is to quieten the mind and  ultimately stop all thoughts. When we are thinking, even if they are positive  and divine thoughts, we are limited by the domain of the mind. In the mind it  is not possible to experience the expansion of consciousness which is the  essence of meditation. To quieten the mind and stop thoughts, is often difficult  for beginners . Sri Chinmoy suggests two things. </p>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Firstly we should  practise concentration</strong>. Concentration  means that we focus on only one object at a time. Real concentration means we  are one pointed in our focus and don&rsquo;t allow anything to distract us. For  example we could practise a concentration exercise of focusing on the tip of a  candle flame. It is good if our concentration can narrow to a small point and  feel our whole sense of awareness fixed on this point.</li>
		    </ul>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&ldquo;In concentration we focus our  attention on a particular subject or object and do not allow our mind to roam.  Thought-waves must stop in concentration. We are like a bullet entering into  something divine, or we are like a magnet: we are pulling the object of our  concentration towards us. This is concentration.&rdquo;</p>
			  <p align="right">- Sri Chinmoy [3]</p>
			</div>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Meditate on the Spiritual Heart </strong>Sri Chinmoy suggests the most  effective method is to meditate on the spiritual heart. It is the heart where  we will feel most readily a sense of expansion and real peace. If we can focus  our sense of awareness on the heart then we are also far from the domain of the  mind. It is in the heart that we will be able to distance ourselves from the  mind.</li>
		    </ul>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&ldquo;The heart is the source&hellip;Inside  the heart is the soul. The consciousness of the soul permeates the entire body,  but the special dwelling place of the soul is inside the spiritual heart. So when  we enter into the inmost recesses of the heart, from there we derive real  soul's love.&rdquo; </p>
			  <p align="right">- Sri Chinmoy[4]</p>
			</div>
			<h3>The Spiritual Heart and Meditation</h3>
			<p>The spiritual heart is an energy centre or Chakra. It is  located in the centre of the chest in close proximity to the physical heart. To  enter into the consciousness of the spiritual heart we should feel our sense of  awareness, and power of concentration is coming from the heart and nowhere  else. </p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&ldquo;You must direct your full, intense  concentration on the heart. You must feel that you are not the mind. You have to  feel that you are growing into the heart. You are only the heart and nothing  else.&rdquo;</p>
			  <p align="right">- Sri Chinmoy  [5]</p>
			</div>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>With practise we will begin to feel a sensation in the heart  centre, which will make it easier to focus here.</p>
			<p>When we are able to concentrate on one object at a time we  will be able to progress to meditation. The difference between concentration  and meditation is that with concentration our focus is one very small thing,  with mediation we identify ourselves with a vast infinite consciousness. To be  able to enter into this meditative consciousness </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Progress With Meditation </h3>
			<p>Meditation is not an easy practise to master. We are used to  using the mind so much that when we try to stop the mind is often  uncooperative. However through repeated practise our meditation capacity will  gradually improve. Sri Chinmoy says that we should view meditation as an  important daily discipline. It is like learning to play the piano; if we wish  to become good we need regular practise. We cannot just sit down and expect to  play a concerto straightaway. It is the same with meditation; if we experience  difficulties in the beginning we should not be disheartened but continue with a  daily practise. Over time we will become better and more able to go beyond the  obstructions of the mind and enter into a real meditative consciousness. Sri  Chinmoy says the real secret is to nuture our inner cry; our inner cry is our  aspiration and thirst for something more fulfilling and illumining.</p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&ldquo;Successful meditation entirely depends on our inner cry. If  we have intensity and sincerity in our cry, then we begin to make spiritual  progress immediately. Otherwise it can take years and years.&rdquo;</p>
			  <p align="right">- Sri Chinmoy  [6]</p>
			</div>
			<p>There are many different paths of meditation each offering  an alternative approach. A seeker should seek to discover a path that feels the  most productive. Sri Chinmoy suggests that that there are many complementary  approaches all of which will lead the seeker to the same goal. However on  discovering a certain approach it is best to stick to one method and not  continually switch between different spiritual teachers and different methods.  If we try to follow 2 or 3 paths at the same time it will just create  confusion. It is better to find an approach then follow it with regular  practise.</p>
			<p>It is not easy to write about the experience of meditation,  ultimately meditation is something that needs to be experienced by the  individual seeker. However, Sri Chinmoy, like many other Spiritual Teachers have  sought to inspire seekers through poetry and meditative music. Poetry and  inspirational writings can definitely encourage seekers to practise meditation.  It is also good for a beginner to associate with other people who are  meditating. Also this will provide additional inspiration to meditate  regularly.</p>
			<h3>Sri Chinmoy Meditation</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/biography.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> began to meditate at an early age when he was growing up in a spiritual  community in South India. Since coming to the West he has taught  meditation through lectures, writings and also through the silence of  his own meditation.</p>
