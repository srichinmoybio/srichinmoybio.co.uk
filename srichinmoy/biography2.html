			<h2>Sri Chinmoy Biography Part 2 </h2>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4><strong>Part 2 - </strong>
		    Sri Chinmoy in The West</h4>
			<p>			  <a name="top" id="top"></a>Sri Chinmoy would have been content to remain in the Ashram furthering his  meditation and taking part in the daily activities; but, an inner Command urged  him to travel to the West to share the spiritual knowledge of the East with  aspiring seekers in the West.</p>
			<p>			  After receiving help from sponsors in America, Sri <img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/images/ckg/consulate150.jpg" alt="consulate" width="150" height="148" class="float-left" />Chinmoy  was able to leave India for America. Thus, on the 13th April 1964, Sri  Chinmoy arrived in New York, USA where he continued to live up until his passing. Initially, he stayed in Greenwich Village.  However, in order to be able to remain in America it was necessary for Sri Chinmoy  to gain employment. He was able to secure employment as a junior clerk in the Passport and Visa section at the Indian Consulate. Sri Chinmoy recalled  how he was fortunate to get the job because initially he failed the  typing test. However, his boss, Mr. Mehrotra chose Sri Chinmoy because he admired  his writings <a href="#ref">[1]</a></p>
			<p>			  Sri Chinmoy worked for two years in the Passport and Visa section. Sri Chinmoy  has recounted many stories from this period in a book entitled &ldquo;My Consulate Years&quot;. <a href="#ref"></a>  At times, he had little money, but he retained happy memories of these earliest experiences in the West. &quot;I<em>n those days I was poverty-stricken, but my  heart was full of joy</em>.&rdquo; <a href="#ref">(2)</a></p>
			<p>			  <img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/images/ckg/greenwich-villlage150.jpg" alt="greenwich" width="150" height="162" class="float-left" />Sri Chinmoy moved to Brooklyn and had to take a long subway journey to reach the Indian Consulate each day.  However, he said he was grateful for these long journeys as they enabled him the  opportunity to meditate in an otherwise hectic day. He later described some of his  subway experiences in a book &ldquo;My Subway Experiences&rdquo; <a href="#ref">(3)</a></p>
			<p>			  On arriving in the West, Sri Chinmoy soon began giving talks and lectures on the  subjects of Hinduism and Eastern spirituality. His first lecture was entitled  &ldquo;Hinduism: The Journey of India&rsquo;s Soul&rdquo;<a href="#ref">(4)</a> Over the course of time, seekers  became eager to study in depth the teachings and spiritual philosophy of Sri  Chinmoy. The first <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/sri-chinmoy-centre/index.html">Sri Chinmoy Centre</a> (at the time called the AUM Centre) was  established in San Juan Puerto Rico in 1966; the second centre was formed in  New York.</p>
			<p>			  The 1960's witnessed significant social upheavals in America and the Western  world. With a backdrop of the Vietnam war, new social movements became  disenchanted with the prevailing societal norms and young people, in particular, began to look for different  approaches to religion and life in general. Yoga and meditation began to permeate  the  public consciousness and became popular through high profile figures, such as  the Beatles, practising meditation. </p>
			<p>			  <img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/images/ckg/early_centre_smiling150k.jpg" alt="early" width="150" height="149" class="float-left" />Some of these members of the younger generation  were attracted to the Eastern  mysticism that was being taught by Indian Spiritual Masters, among whom was Sri Chinmoy.  Following the ancient traditions of yoga, Sri Chinmoy was firm in  stressing that real spirituality involved purity of mind and body. He teaches  that the use of drugs is harmful to spirituality; in this respect he asks his  students to refrain from taking drugs and alcohol. The consumption of these  substances harms a seeker's subtle nerves, making meditation more difficult. Some  seekers who used to experiment with drugs did later confirm there was a world  of difference between the &ldquo;mystic&rdquo; experiences induced by drugs and the real  spiritual experience of meditation. <a href="#ref">(5)</a></p>
			<p>			  In 1967, with the support of a growing number of disciples, Sri Chinmoy was  able to devote himself full time to his spiritual mission. He was able to leave  his job at the Indian Consulate and dedicate himself to writing, giving lectures  and serving as a guide to his meditation students. On leaving the Indian  Consulate, he received many kind comments from his co workers. His boss L.L.  Mehrotra offered the following testimony:</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>&quot;<em>Mr. Chinmoy Kumar Ghose has performed his responsibilities with an unflinching  sense of duty, an unquestionable integrity and thorough sincerity. We wish him  every success in his endeavours to spread India's message of Truth and Love and  spiritual disciplines such as Yoga.</em>&quot; <a href="#ref">(6)</a> </p>
		    </blockquote>
			<p>In the late 1960's and early 1970's, Sri Chinmoy travelled extensively around  America and also to Europe and Asia. He offered lectures and public  meditations at many universities and colleges, including prestigious  universities such as Harvard, Oxford and Cambridge. His lectures were on different  themes related to spirituality and meditation. During these lecture tours, he also established the first Sri Chinmoy Meditation Centres in Europe and the Far East.</p>
			<h4>			  Yoga of Sri Chinmoy</h4>
			<p>			  Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s yoga is firmly rooted in the  spiritual traditions of the Vedas and Upanishads; at the same time, it offers a unique exposition of these ancient ideals. Sri Chinmoy's path encompasses the path of devotion (bhakti yoga), selfless service (Karma Yoga), meditation (dhyani yoga) and  the yoga of wisdom (jnani yoga).</p>
			<p>Despite encompassing these many different aspects, Sri Chinmoy says that in essence: &quot;<em>Our path is the path of simplicity</em>&quot;<a href="#ref"> (7)</a>. In particular, he teaches that it is the qualities of the heart which enable the seeker to make the fastest progress:</p>
			<p class="quote"><em>&quot;Our path is basically the path of the heart and not the path of the  mind. This does not mean that we are criticising the path of the mind.  Far from it. We just feel that the path of the heart leads us faster  towards our goal.&quot;<a href="#ref">(8)</a> </em></p>
			<p>(see also: <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/salutation-australia/part2/19.html">The Path of the Heart</a> at Sri Chinmoy Library )</p>
			<p> The heart is one of the main themes of Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s writings; he frequently encourages seekers  to use the intuitive power of the heart, and not to rely only on the mind. He suggests that when we use  the mind we are limited by our critical and negative thoughts;  however, if we exercise the capacity of the heart we can have a feeling of  oneness and experience the expansion of our consciousness.</p>
			<blockquote>
              <p>&quot;There is a vast difference between what you can get from the mind and  what you can get from the heart. The mind is limited; the heart is  unlimited.&quot;</p>
		    </blockquote>
			<p>&ndash; Sri Chinmoy (<a href="#ref">9</a>) </p>
			<p>As in  other spiritual traditions, Sri Chinmoy reveals that the primary objective of a seeker is to attain self-realisation (or  God-realisation) through prayer and meditation. But, in addition to this inner life,  Sri Chinmoy also places great value on manifestation or dedicated action. In his own life, Sri Chinmoy demonstrated how one can combine a life of meditation and prayer with numerous outer activities. Another feature of  Sri Chinmoy's teaching is his encouragement to surpass one's  self-imposed limits. He gives this the term &ldquo;self transcendence&rdquo;. <a href="#ref">(10)</a></p>
			<p>			   Although a spiritual Teacher (Guru) to many, Sri Chinmoy  teaches that the only real Guru is the Supreme himself. He considers himself to  be an instrument of God, like an elder brother in the family guiding his other  family members. <a href="#ref"></a></p>
			<p>Another important aspect of Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s yoga is affirmation of the underlying unity of world religions. Frequently he has  stated how all religions ultimately lead to the same goal, even if their outer  expressions are different.</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>			  &quot;There is no fundamental difference between one religion and another, because each religion embodies the ultimate Truth. Each religion is right, absolutely right, because each religion conveys the message of Truth in its own way.&quot;</p>
			  <p>- Sri Chinmoy  <a href="#ref">(11)</a></p>
		    </blockquote>
			<p>When asked about his own religion, Sri Chinmoy would often state that, although he was raised a Hindu, his only religion was his'love of God' </p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>&quot;I happened to take birth in a Hindu family,  but because I am a truth-seeker and a God-lover, I feel that there is  only one religion and that religion is love of God. If we truly love  God, we embrace all religions as our own, very own.&quot; <a href="#ref">(12) </a></p>
		    </blockquote>
			<h4>Sri Chinmoy - The United Nations</h4>
			<p>			  <img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/images/ckg/Guru-UN-b_001.jpg" alt="ckg" width="211" height="163" class="float-left" />In 1970, under the auspices of U Thant, Sri Chinmoy was invited to begin an meditation group at the United Nations. The first meditation meeting was held on April 14th, 1970 at the Peace Room of the United Nations Church Centre<a href="#ref"> (13)</a> Later, On 29th February, 1972, Sri Chinmoy had the opportunity to meet with the third UN Secretary  General U Thant at the United Nations. U Thant said of Sri  Chinmoy</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>&ldquo;&ldquo;I have been hearing about you from many, many people. Whoever speaks  to me about you is all appreciation and admiration, and I personally  feel that you have been doing a most significant task for the United  Nations..&rdquo;<a href="#ref"> (14)</a></p>
		    </blockquote>
			<p>			  Sri Chinmoy has written extensively on the United Nations expressing a  belief that the United Nations expresses a most significant aspiration for world harmony  and that it can be an important instrument for bringing people together to avoid  conflict. (<a href="#ref">15</a>) </p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>&quot;What does U.N. Day signify? It signifies a  day of universal hope, a day of universal promise, a day of universal  peace and a day of universal oneness.&quot; (<a href="#ref">16</a>) </p>
		    </blockquote>
			<h4>			  Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s Sporting Life</h4>
			<p>			  Throughout his life, Sri Chinmoy  participated in sports.He has sought to show how sports can be  harmonised with the spiritual life. His interest in sport was not as a means of  competition, but for a practical way of implementating his philosophy of self-transcendence. In the  1978, at the age of 47, he turned to long distance running and trained hard to  be able to complete 22 marathons and 3 ultramarathons. His fastest marathon  time was his first marathon in Chico,California, in which he clocked a time of 3:55:56 Often he would  go training as early as 4am in the morning.&nbsp;  Sri Chinmoy wrote numerous accounts of his running experiences in his  books &ldquo;Run and Become&rdquo;. <a href="#ref">(17)</a></p>
			<p>			  In addition to encouraging his students to run, in the early 1970's, Sri Chinmoy founded the Sri Chinmoy  Marathon Team.The<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/sport/index.html"> Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team</a>  organises a variety of races  from short 2 mile races to triathlons to the world&rsquo;s longest certified race of 3100 miles  held annually in Queens, New York. In many ways the SCMT were a significant  pioneer of the rapid growth in ultra running which took place in the 1980s. In  addition to the <a href="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/3100/about3100">3100 mile race</a> the SCMT have organised the ultra trio 700,1000  and 1300 and also the 7 day and 10 day races. (<a href="#ref">18</a>)</p>
			<p>			  In the late 1980's, a knee injury curtailed Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s running career. He then <img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/weightlifting/images/CKG-256lbs.jpg" alt="weightliftingckg" width="163" height="182" class="float-left" />became inspired to take up weightlifting. This was a sport in which previously he had shown little interest, but  right from the beginning of his weightlifting career, he was able to  make unprecedented progress. Up until his Mahasamadhi (passing), in October, 2007, at the age of 76, Sri Chinmoy continued to lift a unique variety  of different weights.<a href="#ref">(19)</a> Bill Pearl (5  time Mr Universe) has acted as Master of Ceremonies at many of Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s  <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/weightlifting/index.html">weightlifting ceremonies</a>. He has seen Sri Chinmoy lift a variety of objects and  has often commented on his weightlifting feats.</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>			  &quot;<em>This man is of Godly strength. He is truly amazing. </em>..<em>He is trying to lift the attitude of the world. He is showing us that mind can surpass matter&quot;</em> <a href="#ref">(20</a>)</p>
		    </blockquote>
			<p>			  In April 2005, Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s Calf Raise lift was featured in Muscle and Fitness magazine as  the second most impressive sporting achievement of the year. In  September 2006, Sri Chinmoy lifted both Bill Pearl and world champion strongman Hugo Girard at a major  bodybuilding competition before an audience of some 1,500 spectators. </p>
			<h4>			  Sri Chinmoy's Music</h4>
			<p>			  During his Ashram days <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/music/music_srichinmoy.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> received singing lessons from a <img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/images/ckg/esraj150.jpg" alt="esraj" width="150" height="169" class="float-left" />musical  teacher, which helped him to train his voice. However, most instruments he plays  are self-taught; Sri Chinmoy prefered an intuitive approach which enabled him to  compose music from the heart. He has performed at over 700 public concerts;  usually he dedicated these concerts  to world harmony or to certain  individuals whom he felt had contributed greatly to the progress of the world. These included President Gorbachev, President Mandela and Mother Teresa. In 1993, Sri Chinmoy offered 39 concerts in honour of  Swami Vivekananda attending the inaugural World Parliament of Religions in 1893.  Swami Vivekananda was one of the first Indian Gurus to visit the West and he lived on earth for only 39 years. At these concerts Sri Chinmoy plays on a  variety of instruments; these include traditional musical instruments such as  Flutes and Cellos, but also less well known instruments. His most favourite instrument  was the North Indian esraj.  Sri Chinmoy's music is meditative and soulful,  appealing to the heart rather than the mind. </p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>&quot;Music is the inner or universal language of God. I do not speak French  or German or Italian, but if music is played from any of those  countries, immediately the heart of the music enters into my heart&quot; <a href="#ref">(21)</a></p>
		    </blockquote>
			<p>			  Although his aim is to create meditative music, some of Sri Chinmoy's performances on keyboard instruments also express tremendous power and dynamism, especially the organ, piano and synthesizer.</p>
			<p>			  As a composer he has composed over 21,000 songs in both English and Bengali. <a href="#ref">(22)</a> These songs are primarily devotional in nature, expressing different aspects  of the seeker's spiritual journey. Uniquely, Sri Chinmoy has also composed many  songs about individuals and individual countries. These songs are a way of  honouring individuals and highlighting the good qualities of different  countries. </p>
			<p>			  There is a strong relationship between the songs of Sri Chinmoy and his  poetry. For example, the Bengali poems that he wrote as a teenager were later given  melodies and turned into songs.&nbsp; In  recent decades, Sri Chinmoy continued to write poems, but  focused on   aphorisms. These are sometimes very short and are primarily  intended as a means of spiritual instruction. His last major poetry project was a series known as 77,000 Service Trees, of which he completed 50,000. <a href="#ref">(23)</a></p>
			<h4>			  Sri Chinmoy and World Harmony </h4>
			<p>			  Through various initiatives, Sri Chinmoy  sought to promote greater  understanding and harmony between people. To this end, he  met with people  from different walks of life and prominent world leaders to exchange ideas and  offer mutual encouragement. In June 1988, he initiated a unique programme called &ldquo;Lifting Up  the World with a Oneness Heart&rdquo; (<a href="#ref">24</a>) <a href="#ref">(25)</a> During this programme, Sri Chinmoy would physically lift each honoree overhead  in a specially constructed machine. It is a symbolic lift; Sri Chinmoy said  that it is a way for him to offer gratitude to those who have made a most significant contribution to the betterment of the world. </p>
			<p>			  <img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/images/harmony-run.jpg" alt="ckg" width="175" height="175" class="float-left" />To combine running with his aspiration for greater world harmony, in 1987, Sri  Chinmoy founded the World Harmony Run. Initially called the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run it was  later renamed to the World Harmony Run. The World Harmony Run is an international torch relay. The stated aim of the World Harmony Run is:</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p> &quot;The World Harmony Run is a global relay that seeks to promote  international friendship and understanding. As a symbol of harmony,  runners carry a flaming torch, passing it from hand to hand between  members of thousands of local communities, travelling through over 100  nations around the globe. &quot; <a href="#ref">(26)</a> </p>
		    </blockquote>
			<p> The <a href="http://www.worldharmonyrun.org/">World Harmony Run</a> is organized by an international network of volunteers inspired by Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s vision of a more peaceful world.</p>
			<p>			  Another initiative founded by Sri Chinmoy is The Oneness-Heart-Tears and  Smiles programme. This is a humanitarian project that has offered material aid to  45 countries in the world. Sri Chinmoy said the aim is to offer more than  just charity:</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>&ldquo;With our loving hearts, we identify and become one with what others are. This power that loves can solve world problems. This power is full of self-giving, not with a sense of sacrifice, but with the feeling of serving all humanity as our own brothers and sisters. Through both our loving silence and devoted service, we contribute to the betterment of the entire world.&rdquo; [<a href="#ref">27]</a></p>
		    </blockquote>
			<p>			  Even in the evening of his life, Sri Chinmoy was remarkably prolific. He  constantly looked for new challenges and new ways to offer inspiration. In  addition to his numerous outer activities, Sri Chinmoy, also served as a guide to  approximately 6,000 meditation students around the world. He considered the  spiritual progress of his students to be one of his most important tasks. </p>
			<p>Numerous people who have had the opportunity to meet and get to know Sri  Chinmoy have commented on his goodness of spirit, impeccable character and  selfless dedication to promoting global harmony.</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>&ldquo;Sri Chinmoy is an inspiring symbol and apostle of humanity&rsquo;s striving for  peace&hellip; That is what makes him a living legend and a resonant hymn of peace and  goodwill.&rdquo;</p>
		    </blockquote>
			<ol>
			  <li>Dr L.M. Singhvi (LL of Sri Chinmoy) <a href="#ref">(28)</a></li>
		    </ol>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>&ldquo;For forty years, you have been working to create peace among men and  nations through spiritual meditation, music, literature, art, athletics and  humanitarian service.&rdquo;</p>
		    </blockquote>
			<p>			  - President Ramaswami Venkataraman (India) (source The Luminous life of Sri  Chinmoy)<a href="#ref"> (29)</a></p>
			<p>			  Vast as his outer achievements are, many consider that to write the biography  of a spiritual master is actually quite difficult because most of their real  action is on an inner plane. Writing in Hinduism Today.</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>&ldquo;Sri Chinmoy's spiritual achievements eclipse his outer feats, vast as they  are&nbsp; The marrow of his path is mystic  communion, with the Absolute within; through prayer and meditation, approached  with an ingenuous purity, tinged, like his kaleidoscopic wardrobe, with an  enchanting other-worldliness.&rdquo; (30)</p>
