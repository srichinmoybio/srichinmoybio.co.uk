			<div class="poem">
			  <p >&quot;By the inquiry 'Who am I?'. <br />
			    The thought 'who am I?' will destroy all other    thoughts, <br />
			    and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself    in the end get destroyed. Then, there will arise Self-realization.&quot;</p>
			  <p >&nbsp;</p>
			  <p > &quot; As thoughts arise, destroying them utterly without any residue in the very    place of their origin is non-attachment. Just as the pearl-diver ties a stone    to his waist, sinks to the bottom of the sea and there takes the pearls, so    each one of us should be endowed with non-attachment, dive within oneself and    obtain the Self-Pearl.&quot; </p>
			  <p >&nbsp;</p>
			  <p >&quot;Happiness is your nature.<br />
			    It is not wrong to desire it.<br />
			    What is wrong is seeking it outside <br />
			    when it is inside. &quot;</p>
			  <p ><br />
                            </p>
			  <p >&quot; If one wants to abide in the thought-free state, a struggle is inevitable.<br />
			    One must fight one's way through before regaining one's original primal state. <br />
			    If one succeeds in the fight and reaches the goal, the enemy, namely the thoughts,<br />
			    will all subside in the Self and disappear entirely. &quot; </p>
			  <p >&nbsp;</p>
			  <p >&quot; Mind is consciousness which has put on limitations. <br />
			    You are originally unlimited and perfect.<br />
			    Later you take on limitations and become the mind.&quot;<br />
			    <br />
                            </p>
			  <p >&quot;You need not aspire for or get any new state.<br />
			    Get rid of your present thoughts, that is all.&quot;<br />
			    <br />
                            </p>
			  <p >&quot; The Guru is both external and internal.<br />
			    From the exterior he gives a push to the mind to turn it inwards. <br />
			    From the interior he pulls the mind towards the Self and helps in the quieting of the mind. That is the Guru&rsquo;s grace.<br />
			    There is no difference between God, Guru and the Self.&quot;</p>
			  <p >&nbsp; </p>
			  <p >&quot;Surrender appears easy because people imagine that, once they say with their lips &lsquo;I surrender&rsquo; and put their burdens on their Lord, they can be free and do what they like. But the fact is that you can have no likes or dislikes after your surrender; your will should become completely non-existent, the Lord&rsquo;s will taking its place.</p>
			  <p ><br />
                            </p>
			  <p > &quot; Creation is neither good nor bad; it is as it is. It is the human mind which puts all sorts of constructions on it, seeing things from its own angle and interpreting them to suit its own interests. A woman is just a woman, but one mind calls her &quot;mother,&quot; another &quot;sister,&quot; and still another &quot;aunt&quot; and so on. Men love women, hate snakes, and are indifferent to the grass and stones by the roadside. These value-judgments are the cause of all the misery in the world. Creation is like a peepul tree: birds come to eat its fruit, or take shelter in its branches, men cool themselves in its shade, but some may hang themselves on it. Yet the tree continues to lead its quiet life, unconcerned with and unaware of all the uses it is put to. It is the human mind that creates its own difficulties and then cries for help. Is God so partial as to give peace to one person and sorrow to another? In creation there is room for everything, but man refuses to see the good, the healthy and the beautiful. Instead, he goes on whining, like the hungry man who sits beside the tasty dish and who, instead of stretching out his hand to satisfy his hunger, goes on lamenting, &quot;Whose fault is it, God&rsquo;s or man&rsquo;s? &quot; </p>
