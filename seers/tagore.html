			<h4 >Rabindranath Tagore - short biography </h4>
			<p>Rabindranath Tagore is regarded as one of India&rsquo;s finest  writers. For his publication of Gitanjali Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize for  Literature in 1913 -the first Asian to receive the award. Tagore was also  knighted by Britain in 1915, however Tagore was to surrender his knighthood in  protest after the Amritsar massacre of 1919.</p>
			<p> Tagore was the son of renowned Rishi Debendranath Tagore.  Debendranath Tagore was well known as a religious and cultural reformer. When  Rabindranath was a young child, his father requested him to sing a soulful song  he had been singing. Debindranath was so moved by his sons singing he entered  into trance. He was so happy he wished to honour Rabindranath&rsquo;s singing by giving him a  cheque for 500 Rupees.</p>
			<p>Tagore went on to contribute most significantly to the cultural renaissance of  Bengal and India. He was both a poet and musician composing many songs and poems  as well as writing many essays on religion, nationalism and philosophy. In the evening of his life he  also turned his attention towards art.&nbsp;  A project dear to his heart was his school at Santiniketan (Abode of  Peace) Tagore spent most of his life there and here he also completed much of his  writings. Rabindranath Tagore was also famous in the West, in particular the Irish poet W.B. Yeats was very fond of Tagore's writings and this helped raise his profile. </p>
			<p>In the beginning Tagore received higher honour in the West than  in his own native country. It was an unfortunate experience for Tagore  that before his Nobel Peace  Prize in 1913 he was unappreciated in his own homeland. A funny story relates  to how a Bengali newspaper editor mercilessly criticised the writings of  Tagore. However shortly afterwards Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize the very  next week the same newspaper editor offered his heartest congratulations and  appreciation </p>
			<p>As a result of his popularity in the West he was invited to many  lecture tours. This enabled Tagore to became an important figure head and representative of Indian  culture. Through his poems and writings on the &quot;unity consciousness Tagore sought to break down barriers between different countries especially bringing together the diverse cultures of East and West. </p>
			<p>Rabindranath Tagore passed away on August 7th 1941, he had composed his last poem only hours before. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4 >Sri Chinmoy's appreciation of Tagore</h4>
			<p  >Rabindranath Tagore wrote: </p>
			<p class="poem"  ><em>To the birds You gave songs, &nbsp; <br />
			  The birds gave You songs in return. <br />
			  You gave me only a voice, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
			  But You asked for more, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
			  And I sing.</em> </p>
			<p  >- <span class="style4">Tagore<a href="#bib"> (From: Stray Birds 4</a></span>) </p>
			<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &quot;<span >Rabindranath was a Golden Song sung by the Divine Singer in  him. He was, indeed, the World-Song, the golden chain that bound East and West.  &nbsp; <br />
  <br />
    He offered the world more than two thousand songs. He once  said that when he was capable of singing, his own compositions were very few in  number. But when he had become a prolific composer, his voice failed him and he  was unable to sing most of his own songs. &nbsp; <br />
  <br />
    He made a prophetic utterance about his own songs: &ldquo;With the  march of time, everything changes. But the Bengalees will sing my songs epoch  after epoch. They will sing my songs in the hour of their sorrow, grief, joy  and delight. They will have no alternative.&rdquo;</span></p>
			<p ><span > In the song I shall now sing, Tagore compares the Pole-Star,  fixed and steady in the dark night, with the light of the mind and heart which  illumines the unlit existence of human life:</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; </p>
			<p class="poem"  >&quot;<em>Nivid ghana andhare jwalichhe Dhruva tara &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
			<p class="poem"  ><em>In the tenebrous gloom shines the Pole-Star; &nbsp; </em></p>
			<p class="poem"  ><em>O my mind, in the immense expanse of night, &nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
			<p class="poem"  ><em>Lose not your Way. &nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
			<p class="poem"  ><em>Dead with depression and despair, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
			<p class="poem"  ><em>O my heart, cease not your singing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
			<p class="poem"  ><em>Breaking asunder the prison of delusion, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
			<p class="poem"  ><em>Fulfil your life . .</em> .&quot;</p>

			<h4>Rabindranath Tagore and Bengal</h4>
			by: Sri Chinmoy
            <p ><br />
                <span >&quot;The Bengal of today is a fruitless  lamentation. The Bengal of tomorrow can, however, be the torch-bearer of the  rare fulfilment of the promise of today.<br />
                </span><span ><br />
                  His was the heart that gave no shelter  to the doctrine of the unreality of the finite. His was the genius that had the  quality of universality in a striking degree. <br />
  <br />
                  Glory to Tagore, for through him even  the most insignificant and the humblest Bengali villagers can speak to the  world at large. <br />
  <br />
                  His songs are the songs that in a  twinkling penetrate the heart and quicken the soul. Verily, Tagore's life was a  sacrifice to Culture. His songs were his prayers about this great Culture.</span>&quot;</p>

            <h4>Tagore and Vivekananda</h4>
            <p>by: Sri Chinmoy </p>
            <p >&quot;Tagore and Vivekananda were both immortals of Bengal. In  their own way they spread the light of India. </p>
            <p class="poem"  ><em>&ldquo;Vivekananda was a torrent of fire.&nbsp; <br />
              Tagore was a sea of beauty and delight. <br />
              Vivekananda was a Clarion-call. <br />
            Tagore was a soul-stirring Flute.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p  >Both Narendranath (Vivekananda) and Rabindranath loved  humanity much,<br />
              the former speedily and the latter steadily. <br />
  <br />
              Vivekananda says, in effect, &quot;No time to linger. Awake,  O India! <br />
              and measure the loftiest Height with your dauntless head.&quot; <br />
  <br />
              Tagore says in effect, &quot;First look everywhere, and then  to the Highest,<br />
              O Ind, raise your proud head.&quot; </p>
            <p >- From: <a href="#bib">Mother India's Lighthouse (3)</a> </p>

            <h4>Tagore and Gandhi</h4>
            <p>by: Sri Chinmoy </p>
            <p  >Gandhi-ji's tribute to Tagore runs: &quot;'Great Sentinel' of the East.</p>
            <p  ><span class="poem">&quot;I differ with Gandhi in many respects, but I admire and revere the man highly...</span>,&quot; </p>
            <p  >so says Tagore.              Mahatma's deliverance is nothing other than the fruit of renunciation. 
              Tagore's deliverance is precisely the fruit of fulfilment. Tagore sings: <br />
              <br />
              <span class="poem">&quot;Deliverance is not for me in renunciation, I feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight.</span>&quot;</p>
