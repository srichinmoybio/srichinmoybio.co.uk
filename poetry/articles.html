<h3>Articles about Sri Chinmoy</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/poetry/sri-chinmoy-language-prayer.html">Sri Chinmoy and the Language of Prayer</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Perhaps the greatest impulse to pray comes from our perception of the  degree of separation between our human heart and God. When God is far  from us, we yearn for His Presence. When we are one with Him, we praise  Him. We pray to God in the belief that our prayers will be heard, that  they will bridge the chasm between the finite and the Infinite and link  us to that immense Other. And, in rare moments of mystic oneness, we  feel that prayer can embody something of the radiance and beauty of the  Divine itself.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shortpoems.org/srichinmoy/introduction.html">Ten Thousand Flower Flames</a> at Short Poems.org  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;...I hold the emergence of Ten Thousand Flower-Flames to be without  parallel in this century. No other work of such scope has dared to  posit the soul's journey as its theme and to suggest that it comprises  the true modern epic. Nor, in this age of highly personalised utterance  and opinion, is it fashionable to write public poetry of the kind that  any man may read and comprehend with facility. Ten Thousand  Flower-Flames represents the advent of a new and direct form of poetic  address. It enkindles our souls and infuses us with longings for a  higher perfection. At a time when poetic response has considerably  atrophied, Ten Thousand Flower-Flames moves people. No other testimony  could be as indicative of its worth...&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoypoetry.com/sri_chinmoy_poetry/sri_chinmoys_recent_poetry">The Resonance of Word Music</a> in Sri Chinmoy's Recent Poetry </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;...I believe that this new series reveals a master poet at work,  transforming formal versification into a natural and contemporary  framework for timeless, universal utterances. Within the bounds of a  single rhymed couplet or quatrain, made fluid with metrical grace, Sri  Chinmoy uniquely fulfils our longings for completion, both literary and  spiritual...&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoypoetry.com/sri_chinmoy_poetry/thesis">Simplicity and Power</a> - The Poetry of Sri Chinmoy 1971-1981 </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;..Every age calls forth its poet, someone who is able to express its  deepest ideals and aspirations. The critic who first engages in the  appraisal of this newly emergent poet is faced with vastly different  responsibilities from the critic who deals with writers of an  established excellence. Beyond his direct response to this promising  new body of literature lies the task of creating a climate of empathy  in which the poems may be received by future readers and commentators.  The critic cannot fall prey to hesitation at this early stage. He must  make a bold case for his choice, one that may move others to turn to  the poetry and which may also serve as a point of departure for further  critical studies. And, gradually, with the passage of time and the  accumulation of diverse viewpoints, a perception of the intrinsic worth  of the poet may begin to mature in the public consciousness...&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every once in a while, there comes a writer who makes a staggering  contribution in a hitherto little-known genre and places his stamp upon  it to such a degree that his works become a major point of reference  for all others. The very parameters by which we define that mode of  writing are enlarged and the genre itself is imbued with new weight and  significance.&quot;</p>
