			<h1>Karma Yoga </h1>
			<p>by Vidagdha Bennett <br />
              <br />
            At the heart of Sri Chinmoy's spiritual path is the ancient Indian  concept of Karma Yoga. To anyone who cherishes the romantic notion that  the spiritual life is best described as &quot;meditative seclusion&quot;, or to  anyone who is simply allergic to work as such, Sri Chinmoy's emphasis  on Karma Yoga can pose an initial stumbling block. </p>
			<p>			  What is Karma Yoga? Sri Chinmoy explains, &quot;<em>Karma Yoga is  desireless action undertaken for the sake of the Supreme.</em>&quot; He  frequently refers to it as &quot;selfless service.&quot; </p>
			<p>			  Here in the West, the whole trend of our education and upbringing  inculcates certain fixed ideas in us. We believe, for example, that  some work is more important than others; we measure the value of work  according to its ultimate success or failure; we work in order to gain  some tangible result. <br />
			  But selfless service runs contrary to these ideas which have  become embedded in our consciousness. Those who practise selfless  service welcome opportunities to serve mankind, or rather, to serve God  in and through mankind. Nor do they place superior value on mental work  as opposed to physical labour. The simple action of sweeping a floor,  for example, if performed in a meditative consciousness, can serve the  world as effectively as the most complex academic research. Finally, a  Karma yogi works without expectation. He works because he sees and  feels a divine purpose inside his work. </p>
			<p>			  Karma Yoga, in essence, is an expression of humility. If someone  does not care for name or fame or outer success, if his only desire is  to fulfil God in humanity, then he is willing to undertake work which  others might shun. Mother Teresa was a striking embodiment of this  selfless dedication. <br />
			  Sri Chinmoy is fond of quoting <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/spirituality/sri_krishna.html">Lord Krishna's</a> sublime message to  Arjuna in the<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/spirituality/gita_commentary_chinmoy.html"> Bhagavad Gita</a>: &quot;<em>Thou hast the right to act; but claim not  the fruits thereof.</em>&quot; The mark of a truly spiritual person is that he is  not attached to the results of his work. &quot; <em>His detachment</em>,&quot; Sri Chinmoy  writes, &quot;<em>defies both the crushing blows of failure and the  ego-gratifying surges of success.</em>&quot; </p>
			<p>			  What then attracts someone to follow the path of Karma Yoga? Sri  Chinmoy reveals, &quot;In Karma Yoga we progress toward union with God  through our selfless actions.&quot; Thus Karma Yoga stands alongside the  mighty paths of Bhakti Yoga (love and devotion) and Jnana Yoga  (knowledge) as one of the main gateways to God-realisation. </p>
			<p>			  In comparing these three paths, Sri Chinmoy says, &quot;<em>It is easy for  a Bhakta to forget the world, and for a Jnani to ignore the world. But  a Karma yogin's destiny is otherwise. God wants him to live in the  world, live with the world and live for the world.</em>&quot; </p>
			<p>			  While Sri Chinmoy's path embraces both Bhakti Yoga and Jnana  Yoga, it is the contribution of Karma Yoga that is particularly  significant. In<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/sri-chinmoy-centre/index.html"> Sri Chinmoy Centres</a> around the world, selfless service  involves offering athletic events, musical concerts, meditation classes  and art exhibits to the public. With the exception of the races, these  activities are offered free of charge. Each event involves countless  hours of planning, postering and so forth. <br />
			  Again, in their day-to-day lives, many of Sri Chinmoy's students  work at small businesses&mdash;which <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/index.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> refers to as Divine  Enterprises. These include vegetarian cafes and restaurants, healthfood  stores, florists, laundromats, printing presses and discount stores.  Here they try to create a spiritual atmosphere and vibration to inspire  their customers. </p>
			<p>			  Sri Chinmoy's students take their selfless service as a form of  higher responsibility. If a seeker genuinely accepts the world as such,  then he tries to contribute something to the wellbeing of the whole. </p>
			<p>			  Sri Chinmoy himself, even at age 76, constantly performs  dedicated service for humanity. He offers prayers, composes devotional  songs, draws birds that are symbolic of the soul, gives prayerful  concerts around the world, answers spiritual 
			  questions, and even physically lifts overhead people from all  walks of life who work for the betterment of the world. Each second of  his day is a ceaseless self-offering to humanity. </p>
			<p>			  It is Sri Chinmoy's own dynamic example that has set the tone for  his students. Such is the way of a spiritual Master. Lord Krishna did  not merely give advice to Arjuna before the Battle of Kurukshetra; he  himself became Arjuna's charioteer in the battle. Similarly, there is  nothing that Sri Chinmoy asks of his students which he himself does not  do to his utmost capacity. <br />
			  As he himself has said, &quot;The Karma yogins are the real heroes on the earthly scene.&quot; </p>
