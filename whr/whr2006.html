			<h1><strong>World Harmony Run 2006   </strong></h1>
			<h4><strong>Just a short note</strong></h4>
			<p>By: Mark Collinson </p>
			<p><img src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/images/whr/International-Group.jpg" alt="whr" width="400" class="centre-div"></p>
			<p>It was almost 12 months ago that I embarked on an amazing  6 month journey with the European leg of the <a href="http://www.worldharmonyrun.org/">World Harmony Run</a> that was to take  me through 30 countries and leave me with such wonderful memories that they  will stay with me forever.&nbsp; As I reflect  on what only can be said as the time of my life I cannot help but smile and  feel a loving sense of joy and happiness.&nbsp;  My words cannot truly convey fully my experiences as what I write seems  inadequate the myriad of images swimming in my mind and how many people touched  my heart. </p>
			<p>As I read the current World Harmony Run reports I know what  the guys are experiencing, and how much fun they are having, but at the same  time how much work each individual has to contribute to the whole team to make  the Run function day to day.&nbsp; People  often comment that the running must be the hardest part &ndash; how to keep running  up to 20-30 km a day, every day.&nbsp; But I  feel that the running generally is the easiest part.&nbsp; What people don&rsquo;t see are the stamina, discipline and resilience  that runners need to keep going on the road under generally demanding and  challenging conditions.&nbsp; There is  sleeping in a different place every night, having no personal space, and there  is always something that needs to be done &ndash; whether cleaning the vehicles,  washing your kit, writing the daily report for the website, sorting out the  food provisions, and after all these evening chores, to fit in some much needed  rest.&nbsp; But for me, all this is what  makes the experience so special.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s  good to have routines and each new runner that joins generally adapts to a  World Harmony Run body clock &ndash; long, exhausting, but very happy days, with  blissful sleep at the end of each day. </p>
			<p>Team dynamics is rather an interesting part of the Run.&nbsp; The common thread that links us altogether  is our aspiration for oneness and harmony and how each runner can help create  this in the whole family.&nbsp; It is this  sense of oneness that is created within the Team.&nbsp; It is not always harmony within the Team, but you find that you  learn as much about oneself as about other people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The World Harmony Run is in a constant state of flux and has  an energy and momentum all of its own.&nbsp;  The World Harmony Run runners do not make the World Harmony Run, but all  those people that we meet and those that hold the torch and all those children  that so joyfully run with us &ndash; they make the World Harmony Run what it is.&nbsp; All their wishes for a more harmonious world  that they place into the flame are carried on to the next village, town, city,  country and the whole of Europe and the World.&nbsp;  As a member of the International team I felt such gratitude to be given  this opportunity to meet so many people.&nbsp;  For a fleeting moment the World Harmony Run torch touches peoples&rsquo;  lives, but their heartfelt goodness, their smiles of young and old and express  sincerity for harmony, joy and oneness remains for eternity.</p>
			<div class="poem">
			  <p>If you can create harmony&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
			    In your own life, <br />
			    This harmony will enter <br />
		      Into the vast world&nbsp; </p>
