	 Discovering the Meaning of Life
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>The meaning of life is the perpetual question that has perplexed humanity since the dawn of man's evolution. As one might expect, numerous theories have been suggested as to the real meaning of life. Yet theories and philosophies cannot satisfy our aspiration to know the hidden secrets of life. In essence, the meaning of life is a quest that can only be discovered by the person themselves.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who am I?</span><br /><br />In spirituality we find there is actually only one question that we really need to ask: who am I? If we can know who we are all our problems and uncertainties will be solved. But, to know who we are is much more difficult than we may actually imagine. The natural response is to consider ourselves identified with the body and mind. But the body is perishable, and the mind is a volatile and temperamental collection of transient thoughts. The great sage Ramana Maharshi taught that to discover who we are, we should keep asking the question who am I? However, Ramana Maharshi also taught that the answer would not be another mere collection of thoughts. By constantly asking the question who am I? we seek to dive deep down to where the thought originates from. By asking this question, we come to learn that we are not just our thoughts. At the heart of our existence is the real I, which can decide whether to pursue or reject thoughts. In discovering who am I? we learn that we are not the little I identified with our ego; instead the real "I" is a consciousness far greater than our ego can understand.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">"In the ordinary life each human being has millions and millions of questions to ask. In his spiritual life, a day dawns when he feels that there is only one question worth asking: "Who am I?" The answer of answers is: "I am not the body, but I am the Inner Pilot."</span><br /><br />Sri Chinmoy  [1]<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meditation</span><br /><br />The path of self enquiry is a certain type of meditation. It is through meditation that we can go beyond the realm of the mind to discover the spiritual aspect of ourselves. We may find meditation difficult in the beginning, but, through practising concentration and meditation techniques, we eventually learn to stop the mind completely. If we can attain a state of consciousness free of thought, we will look upon the world with a new perspective. Through being unencumbered with thoughts, we discover the limitations of the mind; we also learn of the inner joy that is not dependent on our outer circumstances.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Conditioning.</span><br /><br />There is great power in social conditioning. The way we are brought up reflects our perspective of life. We tend to feel that what society and our family expect is what we should follow. If we are brought up in one way, we often feel that this must be the best way; people either do not want, or cannot, question the ingrained orthodoxy of life. The great philosophical appeal of Socrates was that he taught people to question everything, even if that means going against the grain of popular opinion. To discover the meaning of life we have to be ready to question and, if necessary, jettison our long cherished beliefs. There is a Zen analogy, that we cannot fill a glass that is already full. If we wish to fill the glass with knowledge, we first have to empty it of our existing beliefs. Similarly, if we empty the mind, only then can we fill it with spiritual knowledge on the meaning of life.<br /><br />Discovering the meaning of life is a life long process, it cannot be reduced to a philosophical mathematical formula (although 42 was not a bad effort *). The meaning of life is not something that can be forced on others, it is really synonymous with the discovery of our higher self,<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">References:</span><br /><br />[1]<a href="ttp://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/yoga-spiritual-life/2.html"> Yoga and the Spiritual Life</a> at Sri Chinmoy Library<br /><br /><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/peace-pilgrim/1.html">The Meaning of Life</a> at Sri Chinmoy Library<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Off Topic Musings on the Meaning of Life</span><br /><br />* In Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy, Deep Thought returned an answer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life%2C_the_Universe%2C_and_Everything">42</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/spirituality.html">spirituality</a></p>

	 What does a Red Traffic Light Mean to You?
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Whenever I fly to New York I cannot help but notice all the adverts for HSBC, "the local global bank", or something like that. What impresses me is that they show how the same thing can give either a very good or very bad connotation, depending on our frame of mind / social conditioning. Just for one example, the idea of 2 weeks lying on a beach is my idea of a terribly boring holiday. At the same time, others may find a cycling tour through the swiss Alps, perfect hell.<br /><br /><br />There are many things that we consider to be a bad thing, but is it actually fair to maintain this attitude? Is it possible to see good things in everything?<br /><br />For example, my instinctive feeling is that a red traffic light is a bad thing: it delays our progress, it is a waste of time. If all our lights are green then we feel the Gods are smiling on us. If all the traffic light are red, we feel perfectly miserable and become convinced the whole world is conspiring against us. As a cyclist, a red light at a pedestrian crossing, only creates a temptation to ignore it and cycle through anyway.<br /><br />Reading this essay from Everest Aspiration, by Sri Chinmoy, inspired me to look upon red traffic lights in another light(pardon the pun)<br /><br />"The red stoplight discourages me when I am in a hurry. The same red light soothes my life when I am not in a hurry..." [1]<br /><br /><br />Instead of seeing a red light as an obstacle on the journey, it is an opportunity to be mentally still, not exactly meditation; but rather than entertaining thoughts of frustrations and impatience I can, at least, try to hold neutral / positive thoughts. A red light is not a meaningless obstacle but a necessary item to allow a smooth journey.<br /><br />The great spiritual traditions teach us that real happiness is not dependent on external circumstances. Real happiness stems from our state of mind. Whatever may befall us in the outer life, it is our inner attitude that determines whether it is a good thing or not. We may go through life, metaphorically praying all the traffic lights will be green, but God may not want to fulfil this desire. If we pray for all obstacles to be cleared we will never learn that even red traffic lights can be an opportunity for reflection, inner poise and an inner self transcendence.<br /><br />So even commercial adverts can have a scope for spiritual instruction, it just shows that our mental perceptions will determine our outlook quite significantly.<br /><br /><br />[1]  <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sri-chinmoy-everest-aspiration/part3/11.html">The Red Stoplight</a> - essay by Sri Chinmoy: from Everest Aspiration Part 3 by Sri Chinmoy.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/spiritual perspective.html">spiritual perspective</a></p>

	 Dealing With Stress
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Stress occurs because we struggle to deal with issues as they arise. Stress seems to be an almost inevitable part of modern life; the pace and demands of our modern lifestyle leave little scope for relaxation. However, if we can learn to let go of stress we can easily become more productive and enjoy life much more.<br /><br />These are some suggestions for reducing stress.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't create More Problems</span><br /><br />If we have many difficult issues from work, we should not create additional demands on our time, like deciding to move house. Wait until one issue is resolved before starting on more difficult issues.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't Create Arguments with Other people.</span><br /><br />Alot of stress comes from disagreements with other people. However, if we are careful we can avoid alot of these unnecessary personality disputes. If people do something we disagree with, then we can just ignore it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't feel responsible for Other People.</span><br /><br />If we are honest we have more than enough difficulties in our own life, without worrying about other people's problems. If we feel responsible for solving other people's problems we are, in a way, inviting unsolvable problems into our life, which can only increase our stress levels. If people come to us for advice, we can offer it. However, we cannot be responsible for the life of others, even if they are a close relation.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't Exaggerate our Difficulties.</span><br /><br />Often when we feel stressed, we feel there is no end in sight. Our mind tends to magnify our difficulties and make them appear bigger than they actually are. We should be careful about not following trains of thought, that only add to our stress. As<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/index.html"> Sri Chinmoy</a> suggests on the power of thought:<br /><br /><blockquote>The ordinary human mind<br />Is a container.<br />You can fill it<br />With good thoughts<br />Or bad thoughts.<br />It is up to you.</blockquote>(1)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is Important?</span><br /><br />When we feel very stressed it is a sign we are not happy with a certain situation. If we are stressed about money issues maybe, in the long term, there are different strategies. For example, do we need to continue working in a high paid job, which places great demands on our time? Do we really need a second job?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meditation</span><br /><br />Meditation can undoubtedly be a boon for reducing our stress levels. Stress is always related to an overburdened mind; it can be difficult to switch off from our daily problems. However, if we practise meditation we can help ourselves to let go of our mental problems, even if for a short time. One meditation exercise that we can try, is to leave the mind and enter the heart. We can visualise ourselves leaving the mind and becoming aware of a consciousness inside our heart. If helpful, we can visualise a peaceful scene, such as, by an expanse of sea. If we are able to focus our sense of awareness on the heart, our thoughts will have less power; over time we can develop the art of not listening to our thoughts at all. This will give us a real sense of inner peace and relaxation. This is a powerful antitode to the stresses of the mind.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Related blog Posts<br /><br /></span><ul><li><a href="http://www.sumangali.org/2007/05/commuting-meditation.html">Commuting Meditation</a> at Sumangali.org</li><li><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/2007/06/art-of-happiness.html">The Art of Happiness</a></li><li><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/2007/06/what-gardening-can-teach-us-about.html">What Gardening can teach us about happiness</a><br /></li></ul><br /><span class="copyright">(1) Excerpt from <i>Twenty-Seven Thousand Aspiration-Plants, Part 3</i> by Sri Chinmoy.</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/stress.html">stress</a></p>

	 How to Find More Time in the Day.
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>How would you like the idea of a 26 hour day or 3 day weekend? In recent years western society has witnessed a significant growth in Economic prosperity and living standards; however, there has been little if any increase in spare time. If anything people struggle, more than ever, to find time for the elusive boon of more time.<br /><br />These are some innovative ideas to help make better use of time in the day.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Don't sleep more than necessary.</span><br /><br />People differ in their requirements for sleep. However, it is easy to sleep for longer than you may need. The mind is prone to lethargy, especially early in the morning. We need to be disciplined to get up early in the morning, so that we will not lose precious hours. The secret to getting up early is to develop a regularity; this can involve a regular time for awakening, which you keep even at the weekends.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Don't try to do Several things at Once.</span><br /><br />Sometimes we feel that if we try to do several things at once, we will be able to complete more than we anticipate. However, what often happens is that we are unable to focus on any particular object. Instead we tend to get stressed and struggle to complete anything satisfactorily. If we take things one step at a time, we will have more focus and will be able to get things done quickly and efficiently, leaving more time for other things.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. See Every Moment as an Opportunity.</span><br /><br />Some things appear beyond our control, however, we can turn many of these things into a productive process. Travel is a big aspect of people's lives; commuting to work can take up to 2 or 3 hours. Therefore, it can be a big burden on our time. If we are thoughtful we will be able to turn commuting time into productive time. For example, if we want more time for exercise, we could try to walk or cycle part of the journey. On the other hand, using a laptop enables us to work whilst travelling by train or coach.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Can we work Less?</span><br /><br />There is a growing phenomena in the West of people developing an addiction to work. Basically, it means that people are always looking for extra things to do. Rather than just completing the necessary tasks, we find extra things to fill our time. This may stem from a desire for perfection, or it may just be that work becomes the easiest thing to do. However, we should feel the necessity and importance of creating time for things outside work. This may involve leaving some less important tasks half undone. If we aim for perfection in everything, we will never have the time for anything else.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Get rid of superfluous activities.</span><br /><br />It is surprising how much time we can spend in doing unproductive tasks. It is easy to reduce the time we spending watching the news and checking email. If we are not careful it is easy to waste time such as: watching the same news items several times, or watching TV - but only because nothing else is on.<br />This does not mean we want to have no time for relaxation and enjoyment. It just means we avoid doing useless things that give us neither relaxation or enjoyment.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/time.html">time</a></p>

	 What Gardening can teach us about happiness
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>It is said Gardening is one of the best ways to be happy, what can gardening teach us about the art of being happy?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be Patient</span><br /><br />For a seed to germinate, sprout and flower can take several months. As gardener's we do not expect instant success. In modern life we often expect and desire things as soon as possible, and when they feel to materialise, we feel miserable. We often lack the patience for things to arrive at the due time. However, if like a gardener, we can cultivate patience we will be able remain cheerful at all times.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Happiness in life I need. <br />But alas, without patience,<br />My happiness remains always<br />A far cry.<br /></div><br />- Sri Chinmoy [1]<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Value the Journey not just the Goal.</span><br /><br />A gardener enjoys the whole process of gardening, from planting seeds to watching the plant grow and flower. If a gardener only got joy when plants flowered, he would miss out on a whole aspect of gardening. In life we should not just aim for results or achievements; we can get happiness from our participation and preparation. Happiness comes not through being dependent on outer success and receiving things; happiness is dependent on our attitude to whatever we are doing.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Everything has its season.</span><br /><br />Sometimes we want to capture a moment of happiness. We think that happiness is something to be treasured and held onto.When our happiness is dependent upon this kind of attachment, we are doomed to experience frustration and disappointment. Nothing in the world is permanent, everything comes and goes. However, this does not mean we cannot remain happy. In autumn a gardener does not become despondent because plants die back. He knows that this is what is expected;  he also knows that next year will bring new life and new growth, possibly better than the previous year. The great spiritual teachings teach us to retain an attitude of detachment at fluctuations of the world.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">For everything there is a season,<br />and a time for every matter under heaven:<br /><br /> a time to be born,<br />and a time to die;<br /> a time to plant,<br />and a time to pluck up what is planted;<br /></div><br />Ecclesiastes 3:1-18; NRS [2]<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">From Winter Comes Spring</span><br /><br />At times life may feel like a barren desert, but no matter how bad life may seem it will not remain like this forever. Sometimes dark periods come and it is hard to see a way through; however, all periods of darkness are temporary. To get through these periods of unhappiness, we can let go of negative thoughts and concentrate only on positive thoughts. We should not contemplate on the present fallow period but look forward to the brighter future.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tolerance</span><br /><br />The qualities of trees and plants are self giving, patience and beauty. No matter how people treat a tree, it continues to offer its shade. When offering its qualities of shade and patience a tree doesn't judge.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">How to achieve happiness?<br />Not by giving, not by talking,<br />But by being.<br /></div><br />- Sri Chinmoy [2]<br /><br />Similarly, if we avoid judging others we will benefit from much greater happiness. When we judge others we bring in the critical mind, it is hard to cultivate happiness when the critical mind dominates.<br /><br />references<br /><br />[1] Excerpt from Twenty-Seven Thousand Aspiration-Plants, Part 224 by Sri Chinmoy.<br />[2] Ecclesiastes, NT<br />[3] Excerpt from Seventy-Seven Thousand Service-Trees, Part 4 by Sri Chinmoy.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Related posts:</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/2007/06/art-of-happiness.html">The Art of Happiness</a><br /><a href="http://www.debramoorhead.com/blog/?p=196">What Gardening has taught me about Life</a> by Debra Moorhead<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/happiness.html">happiness</a></p>

	 Different Stages of Meditation
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><strong>1. Curiosity.</strong><br /><br />The first stage of meditation is learning about what it involves. Some people may have preconceived notions of what meditation is; for example, people may associate meditation with sitting in various yoga postures. However, meditation is primarily the art of silencing the mind and discovering our inner self. Whatever books we read about meditation, it will share this common theme of going beyond the mind and raising our consciousness. However, no matter how much we read and talk about meditation, it is only when we practise meditation that we discover its real meaning.<br /><br /><strong>2. Relaxation.</strong><br /><br />When we first attempt to meditate we need to learn how to be still and relax the body and mind. Some people may actually find it quite hard to sit perfectly still for 20-30 minutes. However, this is essential to meditation. If we cannot keep the body still, we cannot hope to still the mind. After relaxing the body we can then seek to improve our mental relaxation. We are usually used to carrying around a burden of worries and anxieties; we find it difficult to relax. However, the preliminary stage of meditation is to let go of these tension; we learn to forget the past and future and just focus on the present moment.<br /><br /><strong>3. Concentration</strong><br /><br />Nearly all beginners to meditation find that when they try to meditate, they become aware of how busy the mind is. Therefore, the most important thing, to learn and practise, is how to silence the mind. To do this we need to learn the art of concentration. This means to focus on one thing at a time. When we can develop the capacity to focus our awareness on one thing at a time, it means that we will be able to make progress in meditation.<br /><br /><strong>4. Detached from Thoughts.</strong><br /><br />It is difficult to detach ourselves completely from our thoughts. However, there is an intermediary stage where we become aware of our thoughts, but they feel very distant. It is like we are aware of thoughts in the background. However, because we don't give them priority, they feel separated from our consciousness. They are like fish in the sea, which swim past, but don't really disturb us. When our thoughts appear external and separate, it becomes much easier to enter a state of real meditation<br /><br /><strong>5. Silent Meditation</strong><br /><br />Real silent meditation occurs when we can stop any thought entering. When we meditate in real inner silence we will unmistakably feel an expansion of our consciousness. What actually happens is that when we stop the mind we can become aware of the consciousness of our own soul. It is meditation that enables us to experience the divine qualities of peace and joy in abundant measure. These aspects are part of everyone's nature; but, it is meditation that makes them accessible.<br /><br /><em>“When you meditate, what you actually do is to enter into a calm or still, silent mind. We have to be fully aware of the arrival and attack of thoughts. That is to say, we shall not allow any thought, divine or undivine, good or bad, to enter into our mind. Our mind should be absolutely silent.”</em><br /><br />- Sri Chinmoy [1]<br /><br /><strong>6. Samadhi.</strong><br /><br />When our aspiration is intense and our mind completely clear, it is possible to experience very high states of meditation known as samadhi. To explain what is meant by samadhi is really an impossible task. By their very nature, these states of consciousness are far beyond the domain of the intellectual mind. Words can never explain or describe concepts of infinity and immortality. To gain an insight into samadhi it is best to read the writings of a realised spiritual Master, who has actually experienced them.<br /><br /><em>"When we meditate, we try to expand ourselves, like a bird spreading its wings. We try to expand our finite consciousness and enter into the Universal Consciousness where there is no fear, jealousy or doubt but only joy, peace and divine power."</em><br /><br />- Sri Chinmoy<br /><br />[1] What Is Meditation?... Excerpt from Earth's Cry Meets Heaven's Smile, Part 1 by Sri Chinmoy.<br /><br />[2] <a href="http://www.srichinmoy.org/spirituality/concentration_meditation_contemplation/meditation/meditation__glimpsing_the_infinite">Meditation: Glimpsing the Infinite</a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/meditation.html">meditation</a></p>

	 The Art of Happiness
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Happiness is at times an elusive phenomena. In many ways we strive for greater happiness, but often the more we grasp, the more difficult it becomes. Yet, the great Saints and spiritual traditions suggest joy and happiness are an integral part of our real Self.  If we can be discover our own highest self, happiness will become a spontaneous experience, independent of the fluctuations of the world. These are some suggestions for cultivating real happiness.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Minimise Desires</span><br /><br />Quite often we feel that if certain desires can be fulfilled all our problems will be solved. For example, we may think that if only we can get a better job and bigger car, then we will be happy. However, usually when one desire is fulfilled it just creates new desires. Monetary gain can give temporary happiness, but it is no guarantee for permanent satisfaction. If we can minimise desires, we can learn to be cultivate happiness whatever happens in the outer world. Simplicity enables us to enjoy the moment, rather than always looking forward to a better tomorrow.<br /><br /><blockquote>Man's sincere desire:   <br />Grasp, possess and enjoy quickly.  <br />The soul's sincere desire:  <br />Aspire, offer and enjoy eternally.</blockquote><br /><br />- <a href="http://priyadarshan.org/sri-chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a><br /><br />Excerpt from Ten Thousand Flower-Flames, Part 5 by Sri Chinmoy.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Criticism</span><br /><br />Happiness can never be found in world criticism. At times our criticism may be justified, but, if we are honest, our criticism does little to change other people and the world situation. If we spend time criticising others, our mind will be filled with negative thoughts. If we really value happiness we will not have time to be a negative critic. True, the world has teeming imperfections, but, if we really wish to be happy, we should begin by trying to improve ourselves. Quite often when we are criticising others, we are actually only highlighting our own faults.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Appreciation</span><br /><br /><br />Instead of looking at the faults of our friends, we should try to appreciate their good qualities. Others will definitely appreciate this generous attitude. People tend to respond in the way they are treated. If we treat others with respect they will subconsciously seek to reciprocate it. Appreciation of other's good qualities does not mean false flattery. Outwardly we may not say anything, but we will forgive and forget their mistakes, and always seek to bring out their good qualities; this is one of the most effective ways for cultivating happiness.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Judge nothing<br />You will be happy.<br />Forgive everything<br />You will be happier.<br />Love everything<br />You will be the happiest.<br /></div><br />- Sri Chinmoy [1]<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Look after the Body.</span><br /><br />It is possible to be happy,whatever ails the body. However, we can make life easier if we seek to avoid unnecessary health complications. Keeping fit helps both the mind and body. Being active prevents boredom and stimulates the mind. Also, avoiding unnecessary intoxicants will similarly keep the mind and body in good shape. When we overindulge in stimulants such as alcohol and drugs, any fleeting pleasure is followed by pain and hangover. We should never feel our happiness depends on taking various chemical substances.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be active.</span><br /><br />Thomas Jefferson said the secret of his happiness was the fact he was both busy and maintained an inner poise.<br />    <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">" It is neither wealth nor splendor; but tranquillity and occupation which give happiness. "</span><br /></div>[2]<br /><br />If we have little focus and little to aim for, we tend to become self absorbed in small, petty problems. If we have alot to do, then we do not have time to be worried and annoyed by small things. An easy, carefree life is no guarantee of happiness.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meditation</span><br /><br />The aim of meditation is discover the real happiness within. Meditation is the art of silencing the mind, so that our Soul can come to the fore. When our mind is filled with countless thoughts it is difficult to experience any inner peace. At best our mind gives only a fleeting happiness. Meditation expands our consciousness so we are not limited by the thoughts of the mind. It is meditation that enables us to live in the soul.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">"True inner joy is self-created.<br />It does not depend on outer circumstances<br />Or outer achievements."<br /></div><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/biography.html"><br />Sri Chinmoy</a>, [3]<br /><br /><br />[1] The Goal is Won, Sri Chinmoy<br />[2] Thomas Jefferson Selected quotes<br />[3] Sri Chinmoy, The Wings of Joy<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/happiness.html">happiness</a></p>

	 What Unites and What separates People?
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Heart and Mind.</span><br /><br />The real divisions occur when we use our mind to judge and criticise others. It is the proud judgements of the mind which create feelings of inferiority and superiority, and therefore, division. If we use the power of the heart we gain a feeling of oneness. It is in the heart where we can bring to the fore the qualities of forgiveness and compassion. When we look at the world with a forgiving and loving attitude, we do not create division. Living in the heart, we seek to be aware of an underlying unity and oneness.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Religion</span><br /><br />Religion is quite often an instrument used for creating division. When a religion unmistakably feels that, it alone, is the true path to God, division naturally arises. Adherents of some religions feel that only by proclaiming a certain faith, can one be granted salvation. Such a belief inevitably leads to a feeling of superiority; the followers may feel under a compulsion to convert and save others, who have not accepted their particular branch of religion. When religion places all priority on philosophical belief and outer forms, there can seem to be an unbridgeable gap between one religion and the next. Such divisive views can become a pretext for both religious persecution and religious wars.<br /><br />However, we cannot condemn religion just because it can sometimes be used to assert feelings of superiority. When we seek to discover the essence of religion, we find that the heart of religion is not outer dogma, but; spiritual practice, love of God and the search for Truth. When we go deep within, through prayer and meditation, religion becomes a mechanism to discover our real self. Practising religion from a purely spiritual perspective, shows us that spiritual realisation is dependent, not on our intellectual beliefs, but our inner aspiration and attitude.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">"If we live in our oneness-heart, we will feel the essence of all religions which is the love of God. Forgiveness, compassion, tolerance, brotherhood and the feeling of oneness are the signs of a true religion."</span><br /><br />- Sri Chinmoy [1]<br /><br />Many great saints and sages have taught that although the paths are many, the goal is the same. Each religion can lead a seeker to God. The Truth can be approached from different angles; people may call God by different names; but this doesn't change or alter the fundamental nature of truth.<br /><br />Thus genuine religious experience does not divide, but can teach the fundamental oneness of life and the Universe<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nationalism and Patriotism</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">"Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all others because you were born in it"</span><br /><br />- George Bernard Shaw.<br /><br />Nationalism divides when a country feels the need to assert its supremacy. When a country wishes to assert its ideology and values over others, there can be no peace or oneness. Aggressive nationalism also springs from a subconscious feeling of inadequacy or fear. We fear other countries and people, because we feel a sense of weakness. Because of this fear we build walls of separation. Yet, these fears are usually borne of ignorance and lack of knowledge.<br /><br />However, patriotism need not be divisive. A true patriot does not feel the necessity of asserting his superiority. Real patriotism means holding a love for your country. However, this faith does not mean we fear other countries. When we have a sincere love for our own country, our oneness heart can easily extend to the rest of the world.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">"Patriotism is self-enlargement, self-expansion and, at the same time, self-giving to the source. This self-enlargement takes place in the divine way; it is not enlargement of ego. The self-giving and self-offering of patriotism come from the feeling that other countries can derive some light from your own country's awakening. Patriotism is self-giving and self-expansion based on your conscious oneness with all consciousness, your inseparable oneness with all. That is the meaning of patriotism in the spiritual sense.</span>"<br /><br />- Sri Chinmoy [2]<br /><br />Oneness does not require uniformity. Unity in diversity is not a mere philosophical platitude. Sincere patriotism is perfectly compatible with breaking down barriers between countries.<br /><br />The effects of religion, patriotism e.t.c depend on how we look upon them. Anything can be used to create division.
