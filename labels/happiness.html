	 How To Avoid Criticising Other People.
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>It is very easy to criticise other people. In fact, we may be unaware of how much time we really spend criticising other people. When we criticise people close to us, we very rarely help the other person; people don’t react positively to criticism. Quite often, when we criticise, what we are doing is bringing our own negative qualities to the fore. We may get a slight feeling of superiority, but, living in a world of gossip and criticism will bring us neither lasting peace nor happiness.<br /><br />The first step is to make a conscious decision to try and avoid criticising other people. Primarily, we are here thinking of the minor fault finding that the human mind is prone to making. This does not mean we will never be aware of other people’s weaknesses, instead, we are seeking to see the good in people and avoid being unnecessarily critical. Here are some suggestions to avoid criticising other people.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. How do we feel when we are criticised?</span><br /><br />We have all suffered criticism at various times; it is not a pleasant experience. When we are criticised we feel miserable, defensive and angry. If we remember how we feel, we will think twice about criticising our friends and work colleagues. Empathy is a powerful invocation of our conscience. When we are aware of how much our actions can hurt others, it focuses us to avoid creating such an experience for others.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Is this a fault of myself or the other person?</span><br /><br />We are quick to judge others, but skilful to justify or ignore our own weaknesses. It is an irony that when are strongly attracted to criticising somebody’s action, we often have this own defect in our character. For example, we may say about how bad, person X, is for spreading gossip. Yet, we do not think twice about spreading this criticism to all our friends. We gossip to criticise others for gossiping; it is a blatant hypocrisy, and our human mind often fails to see the irony of our own criticism.<br />When a crowd were gathering to condemn an adulterer, Jesus Christ, turned to the crowd asking. “Let the one without sin cast the first stone.” The point he was trying to make is that it is easier to condemn and criticise others, but we would be better off trying to reform our own, not insignificant, weaknesses.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Is there a better way to change our friends?</span><br /><br />Firstly, I think it is a mistake to feel that we can change other people. But, suppose we really wish to discourage some aspect of someone else’s behaviour. Rather than directly criticising their behaviour, we can be more tactful and appeal to their better nature. For example, suppose someone is prone to being moody and miserable. If we criticise them for being miserable, they are unlikely to positively respond to this onslaught of more negativity. Instead, we can encourage them to be proactive in something that they are useful at. If they are able to prove their own self worth to themselves, this will be the best antidote to depression and unhappiness. Basically, if you want people to transcend their weaknesses, always appeal to their better nature. If we just dwell on their negative qualities, we can even make them worse rather than better.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Identify with others sufferin</span>g.<br /><br />Sri Chinmoy suggests that one of the best ways to avoid criticising others is to develop a sense of oneness with others around you.<br /><br />“When you identify yourself with the other person's suffering, you will feel, "No matter how imperfect and useless he is, I have no right to cause this kind of suffering in him. I have come into the world to establish my oneness with others and not to destroy others with my criticism."<br /><br />From: <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sri-chinmoy-answers/part7/56.html">Sri Chinmoy Library</a>  in response to: Q. “How can I not criticise others and what can I do when others criticise me? Sometimes I get very mad.”<br /><br />See also: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/2007/05/quotes-on-love-and-hate.html">Dealing with Anger</a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/happiness.html">happiness</a></p>

	 What Gardening can teach us about happiness
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>It is said Gardening is one of the best ways to be happy, what can gardening teach us about the art of being happy?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be Patient</span><br /><br />For a seed to germinate, sprout and flower can take several months. As gardener's we do not expect instant success. In modern life we often expect and desire things as soon as possible, and when they feel to materialise, we feel miserable. We often lack the patience for things to arrive at the due time. However, if like a gardener, we can cultivate patience we will be able remain cheerful at all times.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Happiness in life I need. <br />But alas, without patience,<br />My happiness remains always<br />A far cry.<br /></div><br />- Sri Chinmoy [1]<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Value the Journey not just the Goal.</span><br /><br />A gardener enjoys the whole process of gardening, from planting seeds to watching the plant grow and flower. If a gardener only got joy when plants flowered, he would miss out on a whole aspect of gardening. In life we should not just aim for results or achievements; we can get happiness from our participation and preparation. Happiness comes not through being dependent on outer success and receiving things; happiness is dependent on our attitude to whatever we are doing.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Everything has its season.</span><br /><br />Sometimes we want to capture a moment of happiness. We think that happiness is something to be treasured and held onto.When our happiness is dependent upon this kind of attachment, we are doomed to experience frustration and disappointment. Nothing in the world is permanent, everything comes and goes. However, this does not mean we cannot remain happy. In autumn a gardener does not become despondent because plants die back. He knows that this is what is expected;  he also knows that next year will bring new life and new growth, possibly better than the previous year. The great spiritual teachings teach us to retain an attitude of detachment at fluctuations of the world.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">For everything there is a season,<br />and a time for every matter under heaven:<br /><br /> a time to be born,<br />and a time to die;<br /> a time to plant,<br />and a time to pluck up what is planted;<br /></div><br />Ecclesiastes 3:1-18; NRS [2]<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">From Winter Comes Spring</span><br /><br />At times life may feel like a barren desert, but no matter how bad life may seem it will not remain like this forever. Sometimes dark periods come and it is hard to see a way through; however, all periods of darkness are temporary. To get through these periods of unhappiness, we can let go of negative thoughts and concentrate only on positive thoughts. We should not contemplate on the present fallow period but look forward to the brighter future.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tolerance</span><br /><br />The qualities of trees and plants are self giving, patience and beauty. No matter how people treat a tree, it continues to offer its shade. When offering its qualities of shade and patience a tree doesn't judge.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">How to achieve happiness?<br />Not by giving, not by talking,<br />But by being.<br /></div><br />- Sri Chinmoy [2]<br /><br />Similarly, if we avoid judging others we will benefit from much greater happiness. When we judge others we bring in the critical mind, it is hard to cultivate happiness when the critical mind dominates.<br /><br />references<br /><br />[1] Excerpt from Twenty-Seven Thousand Aspiration-Plants, Part 224 by Sri Chinmoy.<br />[2] Ecclesiastes, NT<br />[3] Excerpt from Seventy-Seven Thousand Service-Trees, Part 4 by Sri Chinmoy.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Related posts:</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/2007/06/art-of-happiness.html">The Art of Happiness</a><br /><a href="http://www.debramoorhead.com/blog/?p=196">What Gardening has taught me about Life</a> by Debra Moorhead<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/happiness.html">happiness</a></p>

	 The Art of Happiness
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Happiness is at times an elusive phenomena. In many ways we strive for greater happiness, but often the more we grasp, the more difficult it becomes. Yet, the great Saints and spiritual traditions suggest joy and happiness are an integral part of our real Self.  If we can be discover our own highest self, happiness will become a spontaneous experience, independent of the fluctuations of the world. These are some suggestions for cultivating real happiness.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Minimise Desires</span><br /><br />Quite often we feel that if certain desires can be fulfilled all our problems will be solved. For example, we may think that if only we can get a better job and bigger car, then we will be happy. However, usually when one desire is fulfilled it just creates new desires. Monetary gain can give temporary happiness, but it is no guarantee for permanent satisfaction. If we can minimise desires, we can learn to be cultivate happiness whatever happens in the outer world. Simplicity enables us to enjoy the moment, rather than always looking forward to a better tomorrow.<br /><br /><blockquote>Man's sincere desire:   <br />Grasp, possess and enjoy quickly.  <br />The soul's sincere desire:  <br />Aspire, offer and enjoy eternally.</blockquote><br /><br />- <a href="http://priyadarshan.org/sri-chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a><br /><br />Excerpt from Ten Thousand Flower-Flames, Part 5 by Sri Chinmoy.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Criticism</span><br /><br />Happiness can never be found in world criticism. At times our criticism may be justified, but, if we are honest, our criticism does little to change other people and the world situation. If we spend time criticising others, our mind will be filled with negative thoughts. If we really value happiness we will not have time to be a negative critic. True, the world has teeming imperfections, but, if we really wish to be happy, we should begin by trying to improve ourselves. Quite often when we are criticising others, we are actually only highlighting our own faults.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Appreciation</span><br /><br /><br />Instead of looking at the faults of our friends, we should try to appreciate their good qualities. Others will definitely appreciate this generous attitude. People tend to respond in the way they are treated. If we treat others with respect they will subconsciously seek to reciprocate it. Appreciation of other's good qualities does not mean false flattery. Outwardly we may not say anything, but we will forgive and forget their mistakes, and always seek to bring out their good qualities; this is one of the most effective ways for cultivating happiness.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Judge nothing<br />You will be happy.<br />Forgive everything<br />You will be happier.<br />Love everything<br />You will be the happiest.<br /></div><br />- Sri Chinmoy [1]<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Look after the Body.</span><br /><br />It is possible to be happy,whatever ails the body. However, we can make life easier if we seek to avoid unnecessary health complications. Keeping fit helps both the mind and body. Being active prevents boredom and stimulates the mind. Also, avoiding unnecessary intoxicants will similarly keep the mind and body in good shape. When we overindulge in stimulants such as alcohol and drugs, any fleeting pleasure is followed by pain and hangover. We should never feel our happiness depends on taking various chemical substances.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be active.</span><br /><br />Thomas Jefferson said the secret of his happiness was the fact he was both busy and maintained an inner poise.<br />    <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">" It is neither wealth nor splendor; but tranquillity and occupation which give happiness. "</span><br /></div>[2]<br /><br />If we have little focus and little to aim for, we tend to become self absorbed in small, petty problems. If we have alot to do, then we do not have time to be worried and annoyed by small things. An easy, carefree life is no guarantee of happiness.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meditation</span><br /><br />The aim of meditation is discover the real happiness within. Meditation is the art of silencing the mind, so that our Soul can come to the fore. When our mind is filled with countless thoughts it is difficult to experience any inner peace. At best our mind gives only a fleeting happiness. Meditation expands our consciousness so we are not limited by the thoughts of the mind. It is meditation that enables us to live in the soul.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">"True inner joy is self-created.<br />It does not depend on outer circumstances<br />Or outer achievements."<br /></div><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/biography.html"><br />Sri Chinmoy</a>, [3]<br /><br /><br />[1] The Goal is Won, Sri Chinmoy<br />[2] Thomas Jefferson Selected quotes<br />[3] Sri Chinmoy, The Wings of Joy<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/happiness.html">happiness</a></p>

	 How To Overcome Depression
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Depression and unhappiness is a miserable experience. There is nothing worse than a feeling of depression, we should seek to try and avoid depression as much as possible.<br /><br />To Overcome Depression there are a number of things that we can try and do.<br /><br /><strong>1. Do not Dwell on Depressed Thoughts.</strong><br /><br />If we always ruminate over our depressed mindset it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to overcome our depression. Our thoughts influence our state of mind very strongly. Sometimes our depressed thoughts can appear quite powerful, but we need to try and let go of them. If we constantly say no to negative and depressed thoughts, there will come a time when they will stop bothering us.<br /><br /><strong>2. Focus on Positive Things.</strong><br /><br />If it is difficult to stop negative thoughts occurring, another suggestion is to focus on good, inspiring, uplifting thoughts. When we feel depressed, we should force ourselves to think about something good. This can either be about somebody else, or something we have achieved in the past. When we are depressed we may feel to entertain such thoughts is useless. But, even if we are unsuccessful in the beginning, these good thoughts will slowly percolate through our mind. It will have a positive effect over time, even if we don't expect it to.<br /><br /><strong>3. Be Active</strong><br /><br />One of the best cures for depression is to engage in various activities. When we are busy our mind does not have time to dwell on a depressed train of thought. Physical exercise can be particularly helpful; this is because when we exercise we release serotonin, a helpful chemical for improving state of mind Quite often, when we are depressed we do not feel like doing anything. Therefore, we need to try and force ourselves to go and do something. It may be help to do things with others.<br /><br /><strong>4. Speak to Others</strong><br /><br />When we share problems and worries with other people, we can unburden a significant cause of our depression. When we discuss things with others, it helps us to get a sense of perspective. It is important to be able to find someone who will be a good listener. We shouldn't expect others to solve our problems for us. But, at the same time we should feel that we do not need to be entirely self-sufficient.<br /><br /><strong>5. Be Positive.</strong><br /><br />It might be difficult, but we should try to be positive and sincerely seek to throw off our depression. It is a mistake to encourage sympathy and feelings of self-pity. When we attract others to console us, it will not cut off the root of depression; in fact it can often feed the depression.<br /><br /><strong>6. Find the Joy Within.</strong><br /><br />Our real nature is joy, if we can access the soul we can experience this inner joy, which is the underlying essence of our being. When we are depressed we should feel that this is a false reflection of our nature. We should feel the necessity of going beyond this temporary state and bringing to the fore our inner happiness. Also, it is important to have confidence in our self. Our true nature can overcome depression.<br /><br />"...<span style="font-style: italic;"> the strength of the soul's will is far greater than the strength of these undivine forces. If you can bring forward even one percent of your soul's willpower, with that you will be able to conquer your depression.</span>"<br /><br />- Sri Chinmoy [1]<br /><br /><strong>7. Smile</strong><br /><br />Even if the smile is false and forced it may help a little. When we smile we can have a positive effect on our state of mind. The more we smile and laugh the easier it is to overcome depression.<br /><br /><br /><br />[1] How to Illumine Depression by Sri Chinmoy<br /><br />Article by <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/links/contact.html">R.Pettinger</a> May 2007.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/happiness.html">happiness</a></p>
