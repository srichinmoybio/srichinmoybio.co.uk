	 The Meaning of Freedom
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/uploaded_images/statues-sea-777625.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/uploaded_images/statues-sea-777622.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Freedom:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">the ability to do as we choose; freedom from coercion and externally imposed constraints.</span><br /><br /><br />There are many different types of freedom. Firstly, there is political freedom: the freedom to live without constraints from the government. There is also individual freedom: the ability to choose as we see fit, without constraints from others. Finally, there is spiritual freedom; this necessitates being free from the limitations and ignorance of our own human mind.<br /><br />There are clearly different ways to use our freedom. For a drug addict, freedom involves the ability to take as many drugs as his habit forces him. However, the more drugs he takes, the more his concept of freedom is narrowed; the addiction means his life revolves around the necessity of finding and taking drugs. In one sense he has the freedom to take drugs; on the other hand by becoming an addict he loses the freedom to choose anything else. It is here that we start to question whether individual freedom is the highest kind of freedom.<br /><br />The human mind is a creature of habit. When we make decisions, quite often we make them because that is what we are used to doing. We hear people say "I know I shouldn't be doing this" or "I wish I could give this up." However, if we are reluctantly drawn to do an action out of compulsion, can that be freedom? -<br /><br />It is not just in the consumption of addictive drugs that human freedom proves illusory; we can also examine how the traits of the mind create limitations in everyday thought patterns. For example, the mind creates habitual responses to certain situations. If we get criticised, we feel miserable; in the face of injustice, we get angry. It is most difficult to control these emotions; they seem an inevitable part of our nature. We wish to be free, but no matter how often these experiences occur, our reaction is the same. Furthermore, these in built responses of the mind unmistakably lead to suffering and depression.<br /><br />We wish to be free but at the same time we are slave to the instinctive responses of the mind. What kind of freedom is it when we are at the mercy of events in the outer world? Is it really freedom when one word of criticism, can plunge us into the depths of despair?<br /><br />The highest experience of freedom can only occur when we can be detached from events in the outer world. Freedom means we need to have our own emotions and responses under our control.<br /><br /><blockquote>"Spiritual freedom is our liberation from the mire of self-created bondage." [1]<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Freedom means that no matter what may happen to us, we can maintain a sense of inner peace, poise and detachment. This inner peace is essential for a real sense of freedom. It is only when we have boundless inner peace that we are not a victim to our own negative thoughts and habitual responses.<br /><br />How much of our choices are conditioned by the society in which we grow up? If we are honest, we have to admit that if we were born in a different situation, a different place, our life choices would be very different. This is because our choices are a reflection of what society teaches and expects. We may feel it is our freedom to live as we do. But, in reality, this freedom is heavily influenced by sociology and our limited perspective.<br /><br />However, if we can gain an access to our soul, we develop an insight into our life's purpose. This soul's purpose is detached from social expectations. This is real freedom, because we have the ability to choose according to the aspirations of our soul. We are not just choosing what is expected of us. To be really free, we have to be able to detach ourselves from social conditioning and the ignorance of the mind. This can occur only if we dive deep within. This is the difference between inner and outer freedom<br /><br />We may have a freedom to choose anything on an outer plane; but, this freedom does not give us abiding satisfaction; why? This freedom is only a freedom to choose from a limited egoistic perspective. Real freedom is only possible when we become one with the universal consciousness. This consciousness is not constrained by the limitations of the mind. It is all expanding, infinite bliss and real freedom. It is because of this inner bliss and ecstasy that spiritual aspirants are not satisfied by the so-called freedoms of the world.<br /><br />An aspiring seeker does not just want a limited outer freedom; he wishes to escape the cycle of bondage that inevitably creates suffering. In fact, the spiritual seeker, may look upon the outer freedom as a false kind of freedom; a freedom which keeps from discovering our true self.<br /><br /><blockquote>"What is false freedom? False freedom is our constant and deliberate acceptance of ignorance and our conscious existence in ignorance. What is real freedom? Real freedom is our conscious awareness of our inner divinity, and our constant inseparable oneness with the Inner Pilot" [2]</blockquote><br /><br />It is for this reason that the Buddha gave up his kingdom to become a wandering ascetic. In the material world he had all he could wish for, but Siddharta knew that even with this outer freedom he was tied to the inevitable suffering, death and pain of life. The Buddha wanted freedom, he wanted to taste the bliss of nirvana and escape the endless cycle of death and rebirth. With great determination and aspiration, the Buddha transcended his sense of ego; he entered in the perfect freedom of nirvana. In this consciousness, the Buddha was free from the temptations and forces of the world; he regained his Buddha hood and understood the real nature of life, freedom and his Self.<br /><br />[1]  <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sri-chinmoy-freedom-boats/part2/3.html">Freedom</a> by Sri Chinmoy<br /><br />[2] <a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tears-nation-hearts/7.html">Freedom:</a> From the Tears of Nation hearts by Sri Chinmoy<br /><br />Picture credit: by Kedar Misani, Sri Chinmoy Centre Galleries<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/spirituality.html">spirituality</a></p>

	 What can Harry Potter teach us about Spirituality?
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Don't judge by Outer appearances</span><br /><br />Hagrid, is, ugly, cumbersome and uncouth, with an  unfortunate fondness for dangerous animals; but, his heart is in the right place. On the other hand, who can forget the charming, but shallow, Gilderoy Lockhart? Appearing in the Chamber of Secrets, Lockhart gained a job as Master for Defence of the dark arts. Lockhart was able to impress many with his charm, beauty and extravagant tales of daring do - but this was just a cover for his lies and insecurities.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Don't be distracted by Criticism</span><br /><br />Throughout his turbulent school career, Harry gets more than his fair share of criticism. Not least, in the Order of the Phoenix when Harry is subject to much slanderous gossip. Through the eyes of others, Harry is at times hero and other times villian; but he needs to avoid being distracted by both extremes.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Good Friendship</span><br /><br />Friendship is very important for Harry; yet, quite often, his best friends have disputes, especially Hermione and Ron. When Harry is stubborn and proud he feels miserable; when he forgives and forgets he is able to benefit from the strength of his real friendship of those close to him.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Be Courageous.</span><br /><br />"The Soul cannot not won by the weakling." so says the Upanishads. To defeat hostile forces in life we have to face upto them with both inner and outer courage. At times we may wish to flee the battlefield of life, but, this does not solve anything. Quite often there are certain things that we need to face upto, whether we like it or not. Harry needs great courage when he is facing trials such as death eaters, Lord Voldermort, or even his own fears of death.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Difficulties can provide opportunity for Growth</span><br /><br />We would never invite difficulties into life, but, when they come they can be an opportunity to learn from them and grow as a person. Harry has more than his fair share of trying moments. We often feel that, although these create suffering, they also create moments of real satisfaction. The challenges Harry faces make him grow up and learn how to deal with other people.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Patience</span><br /><br />Living with the Dursley's is torture for Harry; yet, it is also necessary. The summer holidays pass very slowly in privet Drive, and quite often Harry's patience wears thin, getting into trouble as a result.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">7. Love Thy Enemy.</span><br /><br />True, Harry Potter does not love his enemies. The hate is easy to see - even if it is understandable. However, the character of Professor Dumbledore, gives an insight into a soul with great nobility. Dumbledore is generous with both Snape and Draco Molfoy; he hopes to bring the best out of each character. Dumbledore is willing to sacrifice his own personal safety for the effort to redeem both these characters. In this sense, Dumbledore displays a Christ like attitude of forgiving his potential enemies.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/spirituality.html">spirituality</a></p>

	 Discovering the Meaning of Life
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>The meaning of life is the perpetual question that has perplexed humanity since the dawn of man's evolution. As one might expect, numerous theories have been suggested as to the real meaning of life. Yet theories and philosophies cannot satisfy our aspiration to know the hidden secrets of life. In essence, the meaning of life is a quest that can only be discovered by the person themselves.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who am I?</span><br /><br />In spirituality we find there is actually only one question that we really need to ask: who am I? If we can know who we are all our problems and uncertainties will be solved. But, to know who we are is much more difficult than we may actually imagine. The natural response is to consider ourselves identified with the body and mind. But the body is perishable, and the mind is a volatile and temperamental collection of transient thoughts. The great sage Ramana Maharshi taught that to discover who we are, we should keep asking the question who am I? However, Ramana Maharshi also taught that the answer would not be another mere collection of thoughts. By constantly asking the question who am I? we seek to dive deep down to where the thought originates from. By asking this question, we come to learn that we are not just our thoughts. At the heart of our existence is the real I, which can decide whether to pursue or reject thoughts. In discovering who am I? we learn that we are not the little I identified with our ego; instead the real "I" is a consciousness far greater than our ego can understand.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">"In the ordinary life each human being has millions and millions of questions to ask. In his spiritual life, a day dawns when he feels that there is only one question worth asking: "Who am I?" The answer of answers is: "I am not the body, but I am the Inner Pilot."</span><br /><br />Sri Chinmoy  [1]<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meditation</span><br /><br />The path of self enquiry is a certain type of meditation. It is through meditation that we can go beyond the realm of the mind to discover the spiritual aspect of ourselves. We may find meditation difficult in the beginning, but, through practising concentration and meditation techniques, we eventually learn to stop the mind completely. If we can attain a state of consciousness free of thought, we will look upon the world with a new perspective. Through being unencumbered with thoughts, we discover the limitations of the mind; we also learn of the inner joy that is not dependent on our outer circumstances.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Conditioning.</span><br /><br />There is great power in social conditioning. The way we are brought up reflects our perspective of life. We tend to feel that what society and our family expect is what we should follow. If we are brought up in one way, we often feel that this must be the best way; people either do not want, or cannot, question the ingrained orthodoxy of life. The great philosophical appeal of Socrates was that he taught people to question everything, even if that means going against the grain of popular opinion. To discover the meaning of life we have to be ready to question and, if necessary, jettison our long cherished beliefs. There is a Zen analogy, that we cannot fill a glass that is already full. If we wish to fill the glass with knowledge, we first have to empty it of our existing beliefs. Similarly, if we empty the mind, only then can we fill it with spiritual knowledge on the meaning of life.<br /><br />Discovering the meaning of life is a life long process, it cannot be reduced to a philosophical mathematical formula (although 42 was not a bad effort *). The meaning of life is not something that can be forced on others, it is really synonymous with the discovery of our higher self,<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">References:</span><br /><br />[1]<a href="ttp://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/yoga-spiritual-life/2.html"> Yoga and the Spiritual Life</a> at Sri Chinmoy Library<br /><br /><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/peace-pilgrim/1.html">The Meaning of Life</a> at Sri Chinmoy Library<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Off Topic Musings on the Meaning of Life</span><br /><br />* In Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy, Deep Thought returned an answer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life%2C_the_Universe%2C_and_Everything">42</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/labels/spirituality.html">spirituality</a></p>
