			<h2>Wednesday Night Function, Nov. 15, 2006</h2>
			<p><br />
              With unseasonably warmer weather lately, we were fortunate to have the<br />
              tent opened up in the back so many people could sit outside on the<br />
              regular tennis court seating and still see the events at the front of<br />
              the tent. The function lasted four hours from beginning to end with<br />
              many exciting and inspiring moments. <br />
              <br />
              Of course words cannot do justice to the feeling of what was truly<br />
              happening inwardly as we shared and received many blessings and<br />
              inspirational performances from others tonight. Ramamoorthy sang two<br />
              songs quite soulfully: Dheyane Janani  and Jiban Debata to set the<br />
              mood at the start. Hiyaphul and Rashmani then came up to sing Hey<br />
              Gopal and Swapane Aso, joined by Sri Chinmoy himself, the creator of<br />
              almost all the songs being sung tonight.<br />
              <br />
              <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/index.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> then read out the `My God-Hunger Cry' Prayers for the next<br />
              few weeks as we repeated them one at a time. This in itself is a form<br />
              of meditation which is at once interactive and introspective. <br />
              <br />
              Kokan then came up and recited a number of poems by Sri Chinmoy in his<br />
              own powerful and soulful style. He also received a gift from Sri<br />
              Chinmoy for all his soulful recitals recently.<br />
              <br />
              Aparajita was next to share his experiences from a recent trip to<br />
              India. He was there for many weeks teaching meditation and singing<br />
              songs by Sri Chinmoy to seekers in New Delhi. He showed slides as he<br />
              told many sweet stories of the kind hearted seekers there transporting<br />
              us to a land where the ancient devotion meets with the modern striving<br />
              for progress and growth. Many seekers were from advanced educational<br />
              institutions, yet the aspiration and sincere longing for a life of<br />
              devotion to God seemed to be present wherever Aparajita went.<br />
              <br />
              Ashrita then shared with us a video of his most recent World Record<br />
              attempt and success in balancing 223 cigar boxes on his chin for over<br />
              5 seconds. He had to stack them all individually in such a way that he<br />
              could pick them up and place them all on his chin without having them<br />
              fall for at least five seconds. It looked very difficult and<br />
              precarious at the same time. Sri Chinmoy said that he gets `scared to<br />
              death' when he watches Ashrita's feats.<br />
              <br />
              Mukul then shared with us a video about a project called `Kids to<br />
              Kids'. Part of the humanitarian aid organization called `Oneness-Heart<br />
              Tears and Smiles', this program offers opportunities to children<br />
              around the world to share things with other children who may be in<br />
              need of even the basic essentials of life. It encourages children to<br />
              become more self-giving and conscious of other people in other<br />
              countries and cultures. <a href="http://www.srichinmoycentre.org/inspiration_group/sri-chinmoy-inspiration-group">Sri Chinmoy</a> commented that he felt that we can<br />
              expand our heart by first feeling like we belong to our parents, and<br />
              our village, then our town, province, country and then the world. He<br />
              said that &quot;When we use our love there is no distance.&quot;<br />
              <br />
              Next was Satyajit's performance and singing group. We sang Khama Karo<br />
            and The Supreme Chant after reciting this poem: </p>
			<div class="poem">
			  <p><br />
			    &quot;My Supreme, My Supreme, My Supreme. <br />
			    God can easily obliterate my past blunders<br />
			    If He sees that the tears of my heart <br />
			    Are absolutely sincere and pure.&quot; </p>
		    </div>
			<p>			  Satyajit recited very soulfully and powerfully some prayers and<br />
			  aphorisms of Sri Chinmoy as the musicians played in the background.<br />
			  This style of performance is unique to Satyajit's group and can be<br />
			  quite powerful and uplifting during a meditation.<br />
              <br />
              Ranjit and his brother Unmesh then came up in their traditional Indian<br />
              dress with ochre turbans and simple single stringed instruments. They<br />
              sang two songs in Bengali, one of Sri Chinmoy's and one other<br />
              devotional song which seemed to transport us to the simple devotion of<br />
              an Indian village.<br />
              <br />
              Sri Chinmoy always celebrates Akuti's birthday at this time of year.<br />
              She is the oldest living disciple at 91 but looks quite younger and<br />
              gets around like someone 30 years younger. She has been the president<br />
              of the Connecticut Centre for over 37 years and still lives in<br />
              Connecticut but travels down to New York quite a bit.  In celebrating<br />
              her birthday tonight, Sri Chinmoy said, &quot;You are my heart's true joy<br />
              and my life's true pride.&quot; He then offered her `infinite gratitude,<br />
              gratitude, gratitude' as the cake came out and we sang the two<br />
              birthday songs. Sri Chinmoy then handed out a special prasad made for<br />
              the occasion, giant cookies wrapped in a bright silver foil. <br />
              <br />
              After a few more birthday blessings and prasad as midnight approached,<br />
              we slowly made our way home into the warm November night which seemed<br />
              now a bit more silent and peaceful after a long and eventful evening<br />
              at Aspiration-Ground. <br />
              <br />
              Gratefully,<br />
              Arpan</p>
