			<h6>He loves Us </h6>
			<p>Last night <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/index.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> was very tired from his trip to Tennessee and the
			  concert there. Others will surely tell about that trip, but I wanted to focus on something else that shows his love 
			  for his students. The trip had been very, very tiring, due to an
			  inordinate wait on the tarmac to take off the previous day, the rushed 
			  nature of the schedule due to travel delays, and other things, as 
			  swell as the usual crying need of so many people who come to see an
			  enlightened man at these performances. He was exhausted, and you could
			  see it in the way he walked and the way he sat in his chair during the
			  function. Sri Chinmoy has written many times that being enlightened
			  does not save you from being a human and suffering all that humans
			  suffer in their bodies, only quite heightened because of the awareness
			  of it at every level.<br />
  <br />
			  In any case, Guru was tired. He told some stories about the trip while
			  seated in his chair under the tent that is erected in our tennis
			  grounds between Celebration periods to accommodate the weather. About
			  200 people were there, and as usual, many visitors among them. He
			  was ready to leave at about 10 p.m. and called for Prasad (blessed
			  food). He had spent almost two hours with us already and really needed
			  to go and rest--my opinion. But someone then reminded Guru that there<br />
			  were some plays that had been prepared. We saw the actors in their
			  rehearsals and costumes earlier as we arrived at the function. So,
			  with great enthusiasm he asked us to bring on the plays. His was
			  not a tired, patient response, but a vigorous one! He knew that these
			  actors had prepared and worked to please him and give him and us joy,
			  and that gave him energy and enthusiasm. His tiredness momentarily<br />
			  vanished in this opportunity for him to give something more to us by
			  listening to our silly plays, which delight him and us so much. Bring
			  them on!<br />
  <br />
			  So we had almost an hour of plays, plus Prasad, and then, even after
			  Prasad, when Guru had given us so much, he still lingered and spoke
			  with us softly and affectionately about a few more things, and only
			  then did he leave. <br />
  <br />
			  For me, when I am exhausted, I have nothing to give. But Sri Chinmoy
			  seizes every opportunity to offer his love, even in the fact of
			  overwhelming tiredness. That is how much he truly loves us. And you
			  feel it.<br />
  <br />
			  Yours,
  <br />
			  Nayak</p>
