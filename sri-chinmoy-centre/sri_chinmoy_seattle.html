			<h3>Sri Chinmoy in Seattle </h3>
			<p>A couple of notes about Sri Chinmoy's visit to Seattle. I believe that
			  word will have already spread about the main events that took place in
			  Seattle, but I would like to note some small things that happened. One
			  note is that <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/index.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> is a terribly careful driver. True, I had the
			  royal opportunity to be his driver during his 2-day visit, but his
			  eyes were ever on the road ahead, and I drove through his eyes. Years<br />
			  ago, when I was driving Guru somewhere in Oregon, he asked me to keep
			  farther back from the cars ahead (this was on the freeway). This was
			  good advice, and I have ever after tried to keep a proper and safe
			  distance behind other cars. <br />
  <br />
			  ON the recent Seattle trip I was driving in Bellevue with the Master,
			  and I looked ahead to see a driver sitting in their car in the exit
			  driveway of a car park, waiting to pull into my lane to join the flow
			  of traffic. I passed by this waiting car, but I should have honked to
			  alert the driver, and I didn't. Guru, in very serious tones, told me<br />
			  that &quot;God made eyes and he made ears, too.&quot; He went on to say that we
			  need to use both in a situation like that. Eyes and EARS. Use the horn. <br />
  <br />
			  ON another occasion very long ago, when Guru was in Seattle, he drove
			  a car for a few miles, and Nandita and I had the privilege of being in
			  the car with him as he drove. I have never seen such a conscious
			  driver. When you and I drive, the driving is just a conveyance to get
			  somewhere, and we talk, eat, daydream and do all kinds of things. But
			  when Guru drives he is 100% in the driving role, and he is very<br />
			  focused on each driving move. He did use the horn for safety. <br />
