			<h2>Function with Sri Chinmoy</h2>
			<p>Report by: Morris Klein  </p>
			<p>Tonight the meditation started a little earlier, at six-thirty, rather<br />
			  than at eight. The reason was that Sri Chinmoy was given an honorary<br />
			  degree from a distinguished Bangladeshi University. The Chancellor of<br />
			  the University flew all the way from Bangladesh to confer this honor<br />
			  upon Sri Chinmoy.<br />
  <br />
			  Sri Chinmoy performed on the esraj for a few minutes; and then he<br />
			  meditated in silence with the guests from the school. After that, the<br />
			  Chancellor spoke about the history of the University and presented Sri<br />
			  Chinmoy with the honorary degree. The gentleman spoke at length about<br />
			  Sri Chinmoy's tireless efforts towards world peace, and in particular<br />
			  his Oneness-Heart-Tears-And-Smiles programme which offers humanitarian<br />
			  aid to the needy all over the world.<br />
  <br />
			  Sri Chinmoy, on accepting the award, spoke about how he lives in<br />
			  America, but his heart remains in Bangladesh. And he reminisced about<br />
			  his native village, Shakpura, and the nearby city, Chittagong, and he<br />
			  said that he treasures his happy memories of his childhood there. He<br />
			  also said that he is offering his heart's gratitude-tears to his<br />
			  mother and father and also to his brothers and sisters, who are now in<br />
			  Heaven. Maybe Sri Chinmoy wanted to invoke their memory on this<br />
			  special occasion.<br />
  <br />
			  After that, Sri Chinmoy lifted the Chancellor and offered his deepest<br />
			  gratitude to the man for offering him this great honour.<br />
  <br />
			  Many groups performed tonight. I particularly enjoyed Satyajit's<br />
			  group's performance. They recite Guru's devotional poetry and sing<br />
			  his songs in a very simple way. But their sheer simplicity and<br />
			  sweetness adds a lot to my Wednesday night meditation. Sri Chinmoy<br />
			  once remarked that when Satyajit's group performs, that people who are<br />
			  sincere seekers get tremendous benefit. He remarked that he himself<br />
			  enjoys their performances very much.<br />
  <br />
			  After that, Sri Chinmoy read out some poems by a Bengali writer of the<br />
			  last century whose name I don't recall. He then also spoke about a<br />
			  famous Bengali novelist, Sarat Chandra, who was really supremely<br />
			  great. He said that Sarat Chandra and Rabindranath Tagore were great<br />
			  rivals. He also remarked that Sarat Chandra had a dog which was<br />
			  uglier than the ugliest and, at the same time, ferocious. Sarat<br />
			  Chandra had many literary admirers, who were themselves writers of the<br />
			  highest order. They would come to his house and the dog would snarl<br />
			  and bite them. But they used to offer the dog so much love. And when<br />
			  the dog died, Sarat Chandra cried as if his own mother or father had<br />
			  died. And his friends and literary admirers wrote poems and stories<br />
			  about this cur and read them out at its funeral!<br />
  <br />
			  Today, September 27, was our late and beloved Jagatarini's birthday.<br />
			  There was a big photograph of Jagatarini beside Sri Chinmoy's chair.<br />
			  She was smiling in the photograph, wearing a beautiful garland of<br />
			  marigolds. He spoke about her tireless service to the spiritual<br />
			  cause, and how her immense soul had come to bless us all. The singers<br />
			  sang beautiful songs in her memory. I will miss her very much, and<br />
			  will always cherish her incredible strength and sincere affection.<br />
  <br />
			  Today is also Sri Chinmoy's twenty-third cello anniversary! What a<br />
			  remarkable anniversary indeed. Many, many congratulations to Sri<br />
			  Chinmoy on this great occasion. I happen to like the cello very much<br />
			  but am afraid I'm too old to learn how to play. But maybe following<br />
			  Sri Chinmoy's teachings means that we're never too old for anything!<br />
  <br />
			  It's getting late so I'll sign off now.<br />
  <br />
			  With gratitude to my vast spiritual family,<br />
  <br />

			  To me, music is not<br />
			  Something that we see.<br />
			  Music is not even<br />
			  Something that we feel.<br />
			  Music is something<br />
			  That we must<br />
			  Grow into.<br />
