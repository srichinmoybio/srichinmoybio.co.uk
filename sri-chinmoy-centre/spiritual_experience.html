			<h1>How to get a spiritual experience</h1>
			<p>By: Abhinabha Tangerman </p>
			<p> <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/spirituality/index.html">Spirituality</a> has become a subject which over the last few decades has  gradually entered into the mainstream of human thought and experience.  Confined only to a limited number of practitioners and well-wishers for  the larger part of the previous century, nowadays with movies like The  Celestine Prophecy, The Secret and Conversations With God coming out at  a regular basis, a new trend in human thinking and striving is  revealed. More and more people seem to be looking for a glimpse or a  taste of God - or the higher reality that name embodies. We are longing  for a spiritual experience. <br />
              <br />
              A spiritual experience may consist of happiness, joy, peace, bliss  or a feeling of oneness and wholeness with life, nature or the  universe. To have a spiritual experience is not a difficult task, if  you are prepared to make a little personal effort. It may happen that  such an experience occurs spontaneously, out of the blue, without us  trying to invoke it. In such a case we should take it as an  unconditional blessing from Above. But there are certain things we can  do to expedite our spiritual progress and have spiritual experiences on  a more regular and rewarding basis. <br />
              <br />
              Prayer and meditation are tools with which we can accelerate our  spiritual progress enormously. Both are ways to communicate with that  higher, divine energy that is both deep within us and all around us.  Whereas prayer is like a flame rising upwards, meditation is an  expanding silence coming from deep within. The difference between  prayer and meditation has been clearly and lucidly expressed by  spiritual teacher<a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/biography.html"> Sri Chinmoy</a>: &quot;When we pray, we speak and God listens;  when we meditate, we listen and God talks.&quot; <br />
              <br />
              It takes some practise, but anyone who is sincere and serious can  achieve amazing results from daily practising prayer and meditation  after a mere three weeks. We feel an inner calm and inner strength  slowly developing inside us. This inner calm is the best possible  antidote for stress. Our sleep will become deeper and in our waking  hours we will be more conscious and aware of what is happening. We will  see that through prayer and meditation the quality of our life  gradually and unmistakably improves. <br />
              <br />
              It is more difficult to meditate than to pray. Almost everybody  knows how to pray, but meditation is something that does not come as  natural to us. In meditation the main thing is to keep the mind calm  and quiet and not to allow thoughts to enter into the mind. This may be  very difficult indeed, especially in the beginning, but through regular  practise the mind is gradually brought under control. The silence  between two thoughts then begins to increase up to a point where we  will eventually experience complete inner silence. This inner silence  is the essence of <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/meditation.html">meditation</a>. </p>
			<p>&quot;Meditation is communication with  silence,&quot; as Sri Chinmoy states. <br />
              <br />
              Prayer and meditation are part of the spiritual life. The spiritual  life is the life that is consciously striving and aspiring to reach  higher levels of consciousness. In that elevated state of consciousness  the communion with the higher reality becomes clearer, more inspiring  and more fulfilling. We start to see a deeper meaning in life, hidden  in the commonest of things. <br />
              <br />
              The most important thing in practising spirituality is never to give  up. And if we are willing to give it a try, Sri Chinmoy has encouraging  words for us:</p>
			<p> &quot;Try to live the life of spiritual discipline for a day,  a single day! You are bound to succeed.&quot; </p>
