			<h1>Bach and Beethoven</h1>
			<p>by Morris Klein</p>
			<p>PLEASE NOTE: ALL of this that is written here is completely in my own words,
			  possibly many things may be erroneous, incomplete, misunderstood by me
			  and absolutely, absolutely unofficial. In any case, I am the only person
			  to be blamed for any possible inaccuracy of my memory.<br />
              <br />
			  I asked Sri Chinmoy if he would explain the essence or the
			  quintessence of Beethoven, as opposed to the essence of Bach.  I
			  explained to him that both composers have inspired me tremendously in
			  my life, but I was wondering if he could explain how two such great
			  composers could be so different.  I also asked Sri Chinmoy if
			  spiritual seekers could make progress by listening to these two composers.<br />
              <br />
              Sri Chinmoy began his response with a rhetorical question, asking if
			  anyone in the world knew less about these things than he does.  He
			  paused for a few seconds and then added, &quot;My mind does not understand,
			  but my heart appreciates it [their music]&quot;.<br />
              <br />
			  He said that when he listens to Beethoven he feels that his music is
			  like a fully blossomed tree: branches, leaves, flowers, fruits.  But
			  then thunder comes and the tree is shaking- but the tree is not coming
			  apart.  And all the branches are moving, moving, moving- each branch
			  is moving in a different way, but the branches are not fighting.<br />
              <br />
			  He explained this analogy by saying that in Beethoven there is unity
			  and complexity at the same time- like a fully blossomed tree.  The
			  thunder, which shakes the tree, is Beethoven's unparalleled musical
			  capacity.  And the branches are moving, each branch moves in its own
			  way, but they are not in conflict with each other.  In other words,
			  inside Beethoven's complexity he was able to preserve unity.  With
			  most composers and artists, once complexity comes, unity goes away. 
			  But Beethoven was able to keep both at the same time.<br />
              <br />
			  He also said that because Beethoven was deaf, he had to get the music
			  from his inner eye, his third eye.  Once he became deaf, he heard and
			  received the music through his third eye.<br />
              <br />
			  He then spoke about Bach.  He said that prayer-life was a very
			  important part of Bach's personality, and that he appreciates Bach
			  spiritual depth.  He said that he does not find simplicity in
			  Beethoven's music, but that Bach's work is simple and yet very, very
			  deep.  I think he said that we can dive deep, deep, deep into Bach's 
			  music.  I also think he said that inside Bach's music there are
			  prayers, that he imbued his music with a prayerful consciousness.<br />
              <br />
			  He then said that if we use our heart we will say that oneness is the
			  only reality, and that we don't have to judge these two composers, or
			  say which one we like better.  But if we are completely honest with
			  ourselves then immediately we will know of whom we are most fond.<br />
              <br />
			  He then said that Beethoven is like a rose, and Bach is like a lotus.
			  And that a garden has so many flowers, and each flower is
			  indispensable to the glory and beauty of the whole garden, but the
			  gardener definitely knows which flower he likes most.<br />
              <br />
			  He then commented that Bach and Beethoven are like a flute and a drum-
			  again so often a flute can play the role of a drum, and a drum can
			  play the role of a flute.<br />
              <br />
			  So, that was, according to a possibly inaccurate memory,
			  Sri Chinmoy's answer in a nutshell.<br />
              <br />
			  I'd be really grateful if other people who had been there
			  would contribute what they remember of Sri Chinmoy's response.  I was
			  standing right in front of Sri Chinmoy, but didn't really catch much
			  of what he said.  Like Beethoven I can't hear very well.  But I'm
			  quite happy not to open up my third eye at this stage in my spiritual
			  development! :)<br />
              <br />
			  I enjoyed Sri Chinmoy's kind and expansive answer to my question as I
			  also love Bach most.  I'm not putting down Beethoven at all, on the contrary!
			  I'm just saying that Bach's music, especially his Passion music, contains some
			  of the most haunting devotional feeling I have heard anywhere.  It
			  seems to come from another world entirely.  I think any seeker from
			  any path would benefit from listening to Bach.<br />
              <br />
			  Thanks for the opportunity to share this, Prachar!<br />
