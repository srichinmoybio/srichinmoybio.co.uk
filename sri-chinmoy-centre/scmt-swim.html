			<h3>Early Stories of Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team </h3>
			<p>by: Adhiratha </p>
			<p>Below are some early swim stories of the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team <br />
			  (SCMT)beginning in 1979. Parts A, B, C, D. <br />
  <br />
			  This Post covers: Part B  Para 4 to 6 (1983-1985)<br />
  <br />
			  4. 	6 mile slow swims - celebrate 10,000 Flower flames 1983<br />
			  A few years later Shraddha who worked at UN organized a swim. It was <br />
			  agreed that we would all do 6.2 miles (10K) within an eight hour <br />
			  period to celebrate completion of Sri Chinmoy's 10,000 poems <br />
			  called &quot;Flower Flames&quot;. There was a line stretched out across a water <br />
			  filled old rock query that the swimmer followed out and back for a <br />
			  lap. Counters were on the beach ( some big rocks and trees). It <br />
			  wasn't competitive but we knew about how far each had completed when <br />
			  we took breaks. We were all quite slow but because of our other <br />
			  distance training we all were mildly confident because we knew how to <br />
			  pace ourselves. I think I was the best time with over 5 hours to do <br />
			  six miles (which in the swimmers world is very, very slow). Most very <br />
			  good swimmers can knock off a mile in less than twenty minutes. I <br />
			  passed the person ahead of me with a few laps to go. When he got out <br />
			  to get a drink I didn't get out to rest. So I was able to finish the <br />
			  distance first. We all felt great, when in a little more time many of <br />
			  us had completed the distance. 6 miles was not a joke especially for <br />
			  us recreationally swimmers. We were feeling sore in different parts <br />
			  from the usual leg, knee and feet pains of running and biking, but we <br />
			  were all quite happy .<br />
  <br />
			  5.	Why not the Channel for a fast, trained swimmer 1984<br />
			  A few summers later one of the European students of Sri Chinmoy who <br />
			  had been a fast speed swimmer in school requested Sri Chinmoy's <br />
			  Guidance on training to possibly try to be swimming in the Olympics. <br />
			  Sri Chinmoy encouraged him to try the English Channel crossing. The <br />
			  swimmer did not really train so much for distance and found the cold <br />
			  too difficult without allowing for aclimitatization. He tried at end <br />
			  of season in October of 1984. He did a very quick few miles (The <br />
			  captain that piloted the boat who also escorted many swimmers, years <br />
			  later still remembered this swimmer because he was so fast but <br />
			  unprepared for the cold).<br />
  <br />
			  6. 	Who else will try the channel? 1985<br />
			  The following March and April Sri Chinmoy mentioned that he felt some <br />
			  of his students could succeed if they trained properly. Some of the <br />
			  those who had done the 6 mile swim in the the earlier year stood up <br />
			  at a function to say they would try, I was not present but had a <br />
			  healthy respect for the channel and didn't want to volunteer, I was <br />
			  very afraid both of that sort of distance and the cold. It seemed <br />
			  like a monumental undertaking. (My father had been a very good <br />
			  swimmer and an excellent national water-polo competitor before the <br />
			  second WW.. When we were growing up, any time some one swam the <br />
			  channel and it was reported in the NY times he would read it out to <br />
			  all the family with tremendous admiration because of the difficulty <br />
			  and the cold water)<br />
  <br />
			  At the same time when I heard about <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/index.html">Sri Chinmoy's</a> statement and <br />
			  confidence I was sweetly inspired that some of his students would <br />
			  even think of attempting this feat and just for the sake for self <br />
			  transcendence. My admiration led me to (secretly at first start) go <br />
			  to the pool. I wanted to see how much I could improve if I went <br />
			  regularly. I began to read some articles and speak to those who were <br />
			  seriously training.<br />
