              <h2 >Sri Krishna </h2>

      Sri Krishna was born in captivity, in the prison of the  tyrant King Kamsa; yet through his life Krishna lived as a liberated soul,  unaffected by suffering, war, desire and other human frailties. Not only was  Sri Krishna a liberated soul, but he embodied the direct descent of the  Absolute Supreme. Even in times of sorrow, suffering and death Krishna showed  perfect equanimity; illustrating his divine unity, and complete mastery of any  situation. Never a victim, always a witness; his human life brought the Divine to the aspiring Earth.</p>
            <div class="poem">
              <p ><em>&ldquo;Because I am beyond the perishable, and even beyond the imperishable,<br />
              in this world and in the Vedas I am known as &quot;the Supreme.&quot;<br />
              One who, with a clear vision, sees Me as &quot;the Supreme,&quot; <br />
              knows all there is to be known; his soul is merged in Me.</em></p>
            </div>
            <p align="right">- The Bhagavad Gita Ch 16  <br />
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Revered even in his  lifetime as an incarnation of Vishnu, Krishna offered liberation to both his  friends, lovers and enemies. Anyone who called on his name with intensity was  rewarded with his blessingful presence. He fulfilled the desires of his  devotees, and then sublimated these desires to allow the descent of pure divine  bliss.</p>
      <h5>Life of Sri Krishna </h5>
      <p>Throughout the long period of history since the time of  Krishna, there have been embellishments and myths developing around the life of  Krishna, but the truth of his Divine realisation and divine manifestation have  been celebrated and sung by the great Seers, Saints and Avatars that have  followed Sri Krishna - the unique descent of Vishnu in human form.</p>
      <p>What we know about the life of Krishn,a comes from two  sources, the Shrimad Bhagavata and the Mahabarata. The Mahabarata deals  primarily with the Battle of Kurushetra, and the epic dialogue between Krishna  and his devoted disciple Arjuna.
        The fascinating early life of Krishna is covered in the  Shrimad Bhagavata.</p>
      <p>Krishna&rsquo;s parents were the devout Vasudeva and Devaki, they both suffered imprisonment at the hands of Devaki&rsquo;s tyrant brother. After Krishna&rsquo;s  birth, he was taken to the safety of Gokula, where he was brought up by his  foster parents Nanda and Yashoda.</p>
      
        <p><img  src="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/images/people/baby-krishna.jpg" alt="baby-krishna" width="200" height="206" class="float-left" /></p>
      
      <p >As a child the baby Krishna delighted the villagers with his  grace, beauty and innocence. But, hidden within this childlike beauty that  enchanted the villagers, Krishna embodied the miraculous power&rsquo;s which stemed  from his own unity with the Absolute Supreme. At the age of 12, Krishna defeated  his uncle Kamsa; freeing the region from his tyrannical rule, but not only did  Krishna kill Kamsa; he was able to grant him liberation, because of Kamsa's one  pointed focus on the life of Krishna (even though it had been constant thoughts  of defeating Krishna)</p>
      <p>From the woodlands of Vrindavan Krishna travelled to  Dwaraka, his capital on the Eastern sea of India. Here he became a great leader  of men helping to establish dharma in the political and cultural life of India.</p>
      <p>Sri Krishna played an instrumental role in the great war of  the Mahabarata. Although he didn&rsquo;t fight, he acted as the charioteer for his  devoted disciple, Arjuna. The epic conversation between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, and recorded by Sanjaya, is the source of the Bhagavad Gita. Exorting Arjuna to  follow the path of righteousness, dharma and overcome man made morality, the  Bhagavad Gita remains an illuming treatise on spiritual philosophy; perfectly  described by Christopher Isherwood as &ldquo;<em>like a university lecture delivered by  God</em>&rdquo; (2) </p>
      <p>Sri Krishna incarnated in a time when unrighteousness  prevailed, and the world was being assailed by hostile forces. He came to defeat the evil forces and bring peace to the world. </p>
      <div class="poem">
        <p >&quot;<em>Whenever virtue declines and unrighteousness rises, I  manifest Myself as<br />
          an embodied being. To protect the good, to destroy the<br />
        evil and to establish righteousness, I am born from age to  age.</em>&quot;</p>
      </div>
      <p align="right">        - Bhagavad-Gita 4.7 and 4.8</p>
      <p>At the time of Krishna, the ordinary people had no direct access to religion. The  widom of the Vedic Seers was only studied by an elite of priests and Brahmins.  The Vedic religion had been elaborated into a vast and complicated system of  rituals that required learned priests to perform them. On the other hand Sri  Krishna offered a path of love and devotion that could be practised without the  necessity ofdeep intellectual knowledge. Sri Krishna, as an avatar,  provided a conduit for aspiring seekers to reach God directly, through devotion  and selfless service. </p>
      <div class="poem">
        <p >&ldquo;<em>At the end of your life, your knowledge of grammar is not  going to save you, O foolish man! Therefore, adore the Supreme Lord, Govinda,  for in that alone lies your salvatio</em>n&rdquo;</p>
      </div>
      <p align="right">Adishankaracharya (2)</p>
      <p>Sri Krishna&rsquo;s divine Romance with the Gopi&rsquo;s of Vrindavan  was the great foundation for the devotional path of Bhakti. This devotional path of Vaishnavism inspired seekers throughout the centuries notably through other Saints and Masters such as Mirabai, Sri Chaitanaya, Sri Ramakrishna and many others. </p>
      <p>An excellent biography of Sri Krishna was written by Vanamali, a contemporary Hindu mystic. This is her description of Sri Krishna: </p>
      <div class="poem">
        <p >&ldquo;<em>Thus, Lord Krishna was not only a precocious child, an invincible  hero, and a mahayogi, but He was the very God Whose contact transforms even  sinners into saints, ignorant men into sages, sense-bound beings into spiritual  ecstatics, and even animals into devotees. Krishna is the human version of the  metaphysical Satchidananda Brahman (existence-consciousness-bliss) of the  Upanishads.</em>&rdquo;</p>
