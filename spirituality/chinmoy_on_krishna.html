              &ldquo;God is proud of His Divinity in Sri Krishna.<br />
              Man is proud  of his humanity in Sri Krishna. </em></p>
              <p  ><em>&quot;Sri Krishna is the beloved Boatman who untiringly plies His  Boat of Consciousness<br />
              between India's unparalleled history and Her unrivalled  spirituality. &quot;&nbsp; </em></p>
              <p  ><em>&quot;The Gita is Sri Krishna's Heart, His Vision-in-Fulfilment.  <br />
              The Gita is humanity's breath, its journey towards Immortality. &nbsp; </em>&quot;</p>

        <p >&nbsp; </p>
        <p >Foremost amongst the Hindu scriptures is the Bhagavad-Gita &nbsp;&ldquo;The Song  Celestial&rdquo; </p>
        <p >          The Bhagavad-Gita is loved and cherished by Hindu&rsquo;s because it  embodies the timeless message of <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/spirituality/sri_krishna.html">Sri Krishna</a>. Through his discourse with Arjuna,  Sri Krishna gives a concise and simple message for the upliftment and fulfillment of the human  Soul. Sri Krishna  speaks with an unmistakable authority, in our hearts we  feel the message of the Gita comes direct from the highest source.</p>
        <p >Sri Chinmoy says of Sri Krishna:</p>
        <p  >&ldquo;<span class="style2"><em>Sri Krishna walked the soil to  annihilate the philosophies of world-shunning spirituality and of  world-grasping materialism. He established on earth the &ldquo;Dharmarajya,&rdquo; the  Kingdom of the Inner Law. He restored the true spirit of Kshatriya heroism,  motivated not by human ego, but by Divine Will, making man a devoted and active  instrument of the Supreme. He brought down to the earth-consciousness the  supreme Truth that earth and earthly life, being inherently divine, must be  made outwardly divine, fully and totally, in every sphere, in every aspect.</em></span>&rdquo;</p>
        <p align="right"><a href="#bib">(Commentary Bhagavad Gita)</a> </p>
        <p >Most significant in the life of  <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/spirituality/sri_krishna.html">Sri Krishna</a> was his cousin and devoted disciple Arjuna. Arjuna representative  of aspiring humanity was the perfect instrument for conveying and implementing  the message of yoga and devoted action.Their relationship blossomed from the friendship of family members to that of devoted disciple and Master. Sri Chinmoy states. </p>
        <div class="poem">
          <p  >&ldquo;<em>Arjuna is the ascending human  soul. Krishna is the descending divine Soul.<br /> 
          Finally they meet. The human soul  says to the divine Soul: &ldquo;I need you.&rdquo;<br /> 
          The divine Soul says to the human soul:  &ldquo;I need you, too. I need you for my self-manifestation.<br /> 
          You need me for your  self-realisation.&rdquo; <br />
          Arjuna says: &ldquo;O, Krishna, you are mine, absolutely mine.&rdquo;  <br />
          Krishna says: &ldquo;O, Arjuna, no mine, no thine. We are the Oneness complete,  within, without</em>.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>
        <p align="right">- Sri Chinmoy<a href="#bib"> (1)</a> </p>
        <p >&nbsp;</p>
        <p >In the Bhagavad Gita Sri Krishna  reveals himself as a direct descent of the Absolute Supreme. As a young boy he  startles his mother by revealing his Universal form. To Arjuna he also shows his universal form, so vast and all pervading Arjuna has difficulties comprehending </p>
        <div class="poem">
          <p  >&ldquo;<span class="style2">Whenever unrighteousness is in  the ascendant and righteousness is in the decline, I body myself forth.<br /> 
          To  protect and preserve the virtuous and put an end to the evil-doers, to  establish Dharma, I manifest myself from age to age.</span>&rdquo;</p>
        </div>
        <p align="right">Bhagavad Gita Ch1 </p>
        <p >It is true that in India many  disciples are eager to proclaim their Guru as an avatar, as Swami Vivekananda  wrly remarked In East Bengal, India the avatars seem to grow like mushrooms.  But full avatars like Sri Krishna are indeed most rare. Many are of the opinion  that Sri Krishna was the most perfect of avatars. Sri Chinmoy says:</p>
        <p  >&ldquo;There are also <em>Anshavatars</em> (Partial Avatars). But Sri Krishna is a <em>Purnavatar </em>(Complete Avatar) in  whom and through whom the Supreme is manifested fully, unreservedly and  integrally. When human aspiration ascends, the divine Compassion descends in  the cloak of an Avatar.&quot; <a href="#bib">(1)</a></p>
        <p >The message of the Gita is that however men may approach the  Lord Krishna so he will accept their devotion. This could be as the heart felt  devotion of the gopi&rsquo;s or through the determined meditation of yogi&rsquo;s of the  selfless service of disciple&rsquo;s such as Arjuna. Sri Chinmoy says:</p>
        <div class="poem">
          <p  >&ldquo;<em>As men approach me, so do I  accept them.&rdquo; <br />
          There can be no greater solace than his to the bleeding heart of  humanity.<br /> 
          If we accept Krishna with faith, he illumines our doubting mind.<br /> 
          If  we accept Krishna with love, he purifies our tormenting vital.<br /> 
          If we accept  Krishna with devotion, he transforms the ignorance-night of our life <br />
          into the  Knowledge-Sun of His eternal Life</em>.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>
        <p align="right">Sri Chinmoy <a href="#bib">(1)</a> </p>
        <p >&nbsp;</p>
        <p >The Bhagavad Gita says much of the great battle of the  Mahabarata but it must not be forgotten the diversity and manifestation of  Krishna&rsquo;s mission during his short life. Of great importance in his divine lila  was the period in Vrindaban as a simple cowboy. It was in Vrinadaban that the  great tradition of Vaishnavism really started and devotional Hinduism found its  most powerful expression.&nbsp; </p>
        <p >&nbsp;</p>
        <p ><>&ldquo;Sri Krishna stole the hearts of the Gopis unconditionally.  The Gopis stole His Ecstasy unreservedly.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
          Sweetness and grace inexpressible, bond unbreakable,  sacrifice unfathomable<br /> 
          - this indeed is Radha, the Mother-Heart of Sri Krishna. <br />
          Radha carries the human soul into Sri Krishna&rsquo;s Heart. <br />
          Sri  Krishna transforms the human soul into the Divine Soul <br />
          and commands it to play  its role in the Divine Play.</span>&rdquo;</p>
