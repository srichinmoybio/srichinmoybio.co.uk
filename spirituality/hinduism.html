			<h3 >The Essence of Hinduism</h3>
			<p>Sri Chinmoy states that Hinduism is more than an outer  religion of certain rituals and formalities. Hinduism is in fact a way of life;  a spiritual code. This spiritual code or Dharma is at the heart of Hinduism and  governs the moral and spiritual practices of its believers. Through the  practise of Yoga proscribed in Hindu scripture adherents can seek to attain  union with God. As Sri Chinmoy writes: </p>
			<p >&ldquo;<span > &quot;Know Thyself.&quot;  This is what Hinduism stands for. This is the quintessence of Hinduism&hellip;<br />
  &ldquo; The most striking feature of  Hinduism is the quest for firsthand experience, nay, realisation of God. If you  study the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad-Gita and other Indian scriptures,  you may be surprised to observe that although each emphasises a particular view  or certain ideas, they all embody fundamentally the same perfect divine  Knowledge, which is God.&rdquo;</span></p>
			<ul>
              <li></a><a href="#bib">Source 1</a></li>
		    </ul>
			<p>As well as stressing the need for  self-discovery, another notable feature of Hinduism is its tolerance. This is  tolerance of other religions, other cultures and other spiritual paths.  Inevitably certain fanatics have ignored this aspect, but the heart of Hinduism  is notable for its inclusivity and oneness. &ldquo;Unity in Diversity&rdquo; is its goal.  Hinduism as a religion is perhaps unique in not stressing the need for  conversion. The Great Rishis and Saints offer the sublime truth that many are  the paths to the goal. Sri Chinmoy states:</p>
			<p >&ldquo; Hinduism is called the  Eternal Religion. It seeks union with God in every way known to mankind. It  wants an all-fulfilling union of mankind with God, nothing more and nothing  less. Its essence is tolerance. Hinduism refuses to think of world religions as  separate entities. Housing within itself, as it does, all the religions of the  world in its own way, it can be called, without being far from truth, a unique  Fellowship of Faiths.&rdquo;</p>
			<ul>
              <li><a href="#bib">Source 1</a></li>
		    </ul>
			<p >&ldquo; True Hinduism abjures all that  divides and separates.<br />
			  It dreams of the Supreme Truth in absolute freedom,  perfect justice in all-embracing love and the highest individual liberation in  unconditional service to humanity.<br />
			  Hinduism gives due importance to all  the spiritual figures of the world. It recognises a great harmony in their  teachings. Down through the ages, the firmament of India has sent forth the  message of Peace, Love and Truth. It has fostered and encouraged the synthesis  of all world religions. Further, Hinduism has always affirmed that the highest  end of life is not to remain in any particular religion, but to outgrow religion  and realise and live in Eternal Truth.<br />
			  Hinduism is the embodiment of  certain lofty, infallible ideals. These ideals within us live and grow, grow  and live. Because of this fact, Hinduism is still a living force. It lives to  lead. It leads to live.&rdquo;</p>
			<ul>
              <li><a href="#bib">Source 2</a></li>
		    </ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>As well as embracing the spiritual wisdom of other cultures,  there is also great diversity within Hinduism itself. The different branches of  Hinduism will appeal to people of different temperaments. For example in bhakti  yoga the seeker meditates and concentrates on his chosen deity (Be it Sri  Krishna or MahaKali), feeling they are approaching God through the personal  aspect of God. Another path of Hinduism, primarily the philosophy of Vedanta,  stresses the Impersonal aspect of God and leads the adherent to see beyond the  realm of matter or &ldquo;maya&rdquo;. Another confusion to outsiders is the multiplicity  of Gods and Godesses within Hinduism, but the Hindu scriptures teach these are  but the various aspects and manifestations of the One Supreme God who embodies  both the finite and infinite and at the same time transcends both. Sri Chinmoy  states how Hinduism happily embraces these diverse paths.</p>
			<p >&ldquo; Hinduism is a river that  flows dynamically and untiringly: Hinduism is a tree that grows consciously and  divinely. Hinduism is variety. Unique is Hinduism in her Mother aspect. She is  blessed with children who cherish various conceptions of God. One of her  children says: &quot;Mother, there is no Personal God.&quot; &quot;I see, my  child,&quot; she answers. The second child says: &quot;Mother, if there is a  God, then He can only be Personal.&quot; &quot;I see, my child,&quot; she  replies. The third child says: &quot;Mother, God is both Personal, and  Impersonal.&quot; &quot;That is so, my child,&quot; she says. And now she says  to them: &quot;Be happy, my children, be happy. Stick to your own beliefs and  learn through them. Grow through them and always be faithful to your  ideals.&quot; Indeed, this is the Mother-Heart of Hinduism.&rdquo;</p>

              <li><a href="#bib">Source 3 </a></li>

			<h3>Hindu Scriptures</h3>
			<p>At the heart of Hinduism are its collection of sacred  scriptures, the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. The timeless  truths of the Upanishads have recently been rediscovered here in the West.  Although the Vedas were written at the dawn of creation the loft utterances of  the Vedic Seers rings true even in the modern age. For example this immortal utterance from the Upanishads: </p>
			<p  >Anandadd hy eva khalv imani bhutani jayante,<br />
			  Anandena jatani jivanti<br />
			  Anandam prayantyabhisam visanti.</p>
			<p  >From Delight we came into existence.<br />
			  In Delight we grow.<br />
			  At the end of our journey&rsquo;s close,<br />
			  Into Delight we retire.</p>
			<p>In the Vedas and Upanishads we feel the authentic voice of a  true Seer in touch with the transcendental Truth. On the Vedas Sri Chinmoy  writes:</p>
			<p >&ldquo;The Vedas have another name,  Shruti, that which is heard. They are so called because they are based on  direct revelation. The authority of the Vedas rests on direct, inner spiritual  experience that stems from divine Reality. A Hindu feels in the inmost recesses  of his heart that to doubt the inner experiences of the Vedic seers is to doubt  the very existence of Truth. Vid, to know, is the Sanskrit root of the word  Veda. Veda actually means the Knowledge of God. As God is infinite, even so is  His Knowledge. We observe in the Vedas, with surprise and delight, that the  Truth discoveries are infinitely more important than the Truth discoverers.&rdquo;</p>
			<ul>
              <li><a href="#bib">Source 2 </a></li>
		    </ul>
			<p>There  is a well known saying that to read a sacred scripture may take a few days, to  understand it a few years, and to live the truths it contains many lifetimes.  The immortal teachings of the Upanishads and the Gita are no different. Sri  Chinmoy says:</p>
			<p >&ldquo;God-realisation abides in  meditation, never in books. This is the supreme secret of the Upanishads. The sages and the seers in the Upanishads asked their pupils to  meditate, only to meditate. They did not even advise their students to depend  on the Vedas as an aid to realising God. &quot;Meditate, the Brahman is  yours! Meditate! Immortality is yours!&quot; At the beginning of the journey of  the human soul, the Upanishadic seers cried out, Uttisthata jagrata ... &quot;Arise, awake, stop not until the Goal is reached.&quot; At the journey's  end, the same seers cried out once again, Tat twam asi, &quot;That Thou  art.&quot;</p>
			<ul>
              <li><a href="#bib">Source 1 </a></li>
		    </ul>
			<p> The Bhagavad Gita has often referred to as the &ldquo;Hindu  Bible&rdquo;. This is not really an accurate comparison because Hinduism does not  rely only rely on one primary text. However the Bhagavad Gita or &ldquo;The Song  Celestial&rdquo; is held in the highest regard because it offers a record of Bhagavan <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/spirituality/sri_krishna.html">Lord Krishna&rsquo;</a>s epic conversation with his devoted disciple Arjuna on the Battle  field of Kurukshetra. Its spiritual inspiration moved Christopher Isherwood to  describe the Gita as: &ldquo;Like a university lecture delivered by God&rdquo; Sri Chinmoy  says this of the Gita:</p>
			<p >&ldquo; Now the Bhagavad-Gita or  the Song Celestial demands our immediate attention. It is the scripture par  excellence. The Gita is the life-breath of Hinduism. The Gita not  only tells us to realise God, but it also tells us how. The Gita introduces three principal paths toward God-realisation: <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/yoga/karma-yoga.html">Karma Yoga</a>, the  path of action; Jnana Yoga, the path of knowledge; and Bhakti Yoga, the path of devotion. Emotional devotion and philosophical detachment not only  can but must run abreast to fulfil the Divine here on earth. This sublime  teaching of the Gita knows no equal. Without hesitation, a devout Hindu  can say that the Gita has been the solace of his whole life and will be  the solace of his death.&rdquo;</p>

			<p><strong>Modern Hinduism</strong></p>
			<p>Hinduism has received sharp criticism for various elements  associated with Hinduism. The treatment of women, the issue of the Caste, and  others. However it must be remembered Hinduism is an evolving religion, over  time cultural practises have been identified with Hinduism even though these  cultural practises have no basis in scripture. For example Sati</p>
			<p>Women in Hinduism -<a href="http://atributetohinduism.com/Women_in_Hinduism.htm" title="women in hinduism"> A Tribute to Hinduism</a> (
			  See <a href="http://atributetohinduism.com/Women_in_Hinduism.htm"></a> on Sati)</p>
			<p>Sri Chinmoy says this of modern Hinduism</p>
			<p >&ldquo;Although it has had its  periods of inertia, Hinduism is not a static religion. A static religion would  lead only to sterility and finally to death. Hinduism has, in its long history,  become an emblem of flexibility, independence, creative thinking, and  spontaneous innovation in both thought and action. Hinduism knows how to  absorb; it knows, too, how to reject in order to sit at the feet of Truth.  Hinduism is a ceaseless mounting cry for Truth. It aspires to be the essence of  an all-embracing spiritual panacea to feed humanity.&quot;</p>
			<p>&hellip;</p>
			<p >&quot;India acts with neither fear  nor a sense of superiority. Indeed, Hinduism has become self-critical of late.  Hence its improvement is dawning fast. It is true that the Hinduism of today  has countless problems. It is equally true that Mother India alone must and  certainly will solve all her problems. An indomitable will is energising Bharat  Mata (Mother India). Progress, both material and spiritual, is being effected  with lightning speed. Of supreme importance, however, is the fact that the  Hinduism of today is going to model itself - not on Western or Eastern or  Southern or Northern patterns - but on the Infinite's own Pattern.&rdquo;</p>

			<h5>Sri Chinmoy &nbsp;</h5>
			<p><a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/index.html">Chinmoy Kumar Ghosh</a> (1931- ) was born into a devoted Hindu  Family. (1) (The family deity was Mother Kali ) For  20 years&nbsp; (1944 &ndash; 1964) Sri Chinmoy  studied in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram giving him opportunity to study in depth  the great Hindu scriptures. As well as studying the Hindu scriptures Sri  Chinmoy has sought to practise and implement the lofty ideals they promote  through his spiritual life of prayer and meditation. On coming to the West in  the 1960s Sri Chinmoy was asked to give many lectures and speeches on the  subject of Yoga and Hinduism. These talks were given during a period of growing interest in  Eastern philosophy and Eastern spirituality, Sri Chinmoy's talks were compiled into a book &ldquo;<a href="#bib">Yoga and the Spiritual Life</a>&rdquo;  These are some extracts from Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s observations and thoughts of  Hinduism.</p>
