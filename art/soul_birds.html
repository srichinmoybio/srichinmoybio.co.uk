			<h1>A Magnificent Obsession</h1>
			<p>To devote oneself to a single thing in  life, one noble undertaking, with every fibre of one&rsquo;s being, to exhibit an  intensity of purpose that excludes all other themes and subjects &ndash; how many  human beings can maintain that commitment? Perhaps the very definition of a  genius is someone who is so obsessed by a single pursuit that it consumes him.  Then it becomes a magnificent obsession and he is compelled to follow it to its  glorious conclusion. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspiration  visits many creative artists in its diverse hues and colours, but there are  certain individuals in whom inspiration repeatedly comes in the same form.&nbsp; Choice of theme and subject is no longer  theirs to make. They are compelled to explore and celebrate the same theme over  and over.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among  painters, we can trace this kind of magnificent obsession in the works of  Vincent Van Gogh who revealed, &ldquo;The cypresses are always in my thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly,  Claude Monet echoes, &ldquo;These landscapes of water and reflections have become an  obsession.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And  in this century we have the towering presence of <a href="http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/srichinmoy/biography2.html">Sri Chinmoy</a> with his bird  drawings numbering more than fifteen million. Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s obsession with  birds began quietly. In December 1991, he was on vacation in Malta with some of  his students. One day he took up a small, square pad of telephone jotting paper  and rapidly drew a single bird on every page using a ballpoint pen. Each bird  was composed of barely two or three sweeping lines and the dot of an eye. His  principal concern was not to accurately render the anatomy and outer  characteristics of the birds, but to convey their essence. There were hints of  species, certainly &ndash; the long neck of a swan, the rounded softness of a  sparrow, the raised crest of a cockatoo, the extended beak of a kingfisher.  There were birds in flight, birds that craned forwards, or peered elusively  from behind the curve of a wing. But there was something very different about  these birds. It was as if they were the outer notations of a mysterious inner  language. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As  Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s signature style developed, he began to create landscapes composed  entirely of birds. Over the years, he has drawn thousands of birds on a daily  basis, using felt tip markers, crayons, coloured ballpoint pens and acrylic  paint pens. But the form of the birds themselves has remained essentially the  same. Sri Chinmoy draws his birds at great speed and with flawless execution.  The slow deliberations of a halting line, the time spent erasing a mark once it  has been made on the page, the concept of filling in a blank space with  painstaking cross-hatching or shading &ndash; all this is foreign to him. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To  a Western artist, perhaps, Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s technique would be an anathema, but  not to a master Chinese calligrapher, for example. Such artists are venerated  because they meditate for hours before committing their brush to paper. Once  they start to paint a character, they complete it in a single, uninterrupted  motion. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Sri Chinmoy uses the same kind of meditative  approach. When one interviewer asked him, &ldquo;Do you have a bird in mind when you  draw?&rdquo; he replied,</p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I  have nothing in mind. I try to keep my mind as empty, vacant and tranquil as  possible. The outer mind is like the surface of the sea. On the surface, the  sea is full of waves and surges; it is all restlessness. But when we dive deep  below, the same sea is all calmness and quiet. It is there that we find the  source of creativity.&rdquo;</p>
		    </div>
			<p><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because  these birds are not the products of the mind, there is an intriguing simplicity  about them, a graphic purity in their appearance. True, they seem to lie flat  on the surface of the page. There is no depth of perspective in their portrayal  and yet they are not static. There is an almost musical rhythm in their  positioning, in the interplay of lines and space. The great philosopher Lao Tzu  once wrote:</p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thirty  spokes converge towards the hub, but it is the space between them that forms  the essence of the wheel&hellip; This is the rule. The material harbours usefulness,  and the immaterial imparts the true essence.&rdquo;</p>
		    </div>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sri  Chinmoy engenders the essence of each bird as much through the spaces between  the lines as he does through his ever-shifting combination of curved, wavy,  elongated, angular and flicking lines.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,  the dynamic movement by which they are created is somehow transferred to the  birds. They are like energy fields, pulsing with life. Nor are the birds  tethered to the page by details of scenery. They exist alone in a white space,  free from embellishments of any kind. This isolation makes them seem more truly  notations, or seismographs, of an inner meaning. Sri Chinmoy has blurred the  distinctions between art, ideographic writing and calligraphy with his ethereal  creations. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like  many a creative artist before him, this gift appears to be self-born rather  than the product of artistic training and accepted shibboleths. He reflects  that he studied a little art in school around 1944, but never had any real  instruction. He adds, &ldquo;Everything I do is entirely the result of God&rsquo;s Grace. I  get all my inspiration from God.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again,  it is becoming increasingly manifest that while this artist pays no heed to  fashion, his style of drawing may itself become fashionable. Recent exhibits of  his works in Paris, London and Vienna have garnered considerable acclaim. But  the primary interest in his work is undoubtedly focussed on the fact that he  has reduced the symbolic landscape to one element &ndash; the bird.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sri  Chinmoy has frequently been asked to explain the symbolism of his birds. He  replies:</p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a man of prayer and  meditation. For me, birds have a very special significance on a spiritual  level. They fly in the sky, and the sky is all freedom. So when the birds fly  in the sky, they remind me of the soul&rsquo;s infinite freedom. The soul has come  from Heaven. When we think of birds, we are also reminded of our Source, and  this gives us enormous joy. I feel that if people come here to view these  birds, their inner hunger to fly in the sky of infinite freedom will be fed.&rdquo;</p>
		    </div>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In  another interview, he made a direct connection between this inner freedom and  peace: &ldquo;Each bird reminds me of freedom, and I feel that freedom lies in peace  and nowhere else.&rdquo; Hence, the beautiful name by which Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s bird  drawings are known: &ldquo;Dream-Freedom-Peace-Birds.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps  one of the most moving comments about Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s bird drawings was offered  by the late maestro Yehudi Menuhin. In a letter to the artist in 1994, on the  completion of Sri Chinmoy&rsquo;s first million bird drawings, Yehudi Menuhin wrote: </p>
			<div class="quote">
			  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is good to know that you,  who have such a great following, can bequeath the world so many drawings and  sketches. We have become so addicted to the camera that we have forgotten how  the ancient travellers entered their impressions on a notebook, both  graphically and verbally. I congratulate you on this wonderful achievement,  which transports us men, who would be winged, to the birds, which we have tried  to emulate.&rdquo;</p>
